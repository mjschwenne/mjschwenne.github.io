To marinate the chicken, make sure the chicken is washed and dried a few minutes before. Take out excess water in the bowl where you will marinate the chicken. Add in all the chilis and lemon juice first. Let this sit for a few minutes, and then add all the other marination ingredients, such as yogurt, salt, pepper, cumin, coriander, ginger, and more. It is better to place the marinated chicken in the fridge for a few hours. The longer you let it stay in the fridge, the tastier the dish will turn out, as the chicken will soak all the flavor. But if you don’t have much time, marinate the chicken for at least one hour and go ahead with the rest of the recipe. After marinating the chicken, you have to get on with cooking it. Take a large pan or pot and put it on medium heat. Add the required amount of oil and wait for it to heat up. After the oil heats up, add in the chicken pieces, a few at a time. Make sure not to add all the chicken at once, or they might not cook well. Cook the chicken on both sides, letting both sides turn brown, or cook for 2-3 minutes on each side. Take it out once done and set aside. In the same pan, add the mentioned amount of butter and a large red onion diced into pieces. Also, add one cinnamon stick for enhanced flavor. Let them cook for 5-6 minutes or until the onions turn brown. After frying the onions in butter, add cumin, ginger, garlic, garam masala, and chilis into the mix. Let it cook for another minute to soak the taste. Then add tomato paste, salt, pepper, and chicken broth into the mix. Cook this mixture and let it simmer until it turns into a thick sauce. You can also blend this sauce mixture in a blender to give a smooth consistency. Add water if necessary. Once you have got the sauce right, add in the chicken you fried earlier and mix it well with the sauce. Now add the last ingredient, which is cream, and let the mixture simmer for 8-10 minutes. For the last step, chop some fresh cilantro over the meal for garnishing. You can also add slices of lemon for added aesthetics. Serve this with bread, rice, or salad for a hearty meal.
