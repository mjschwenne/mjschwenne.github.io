The members of the Task Force where holed up at the Lost Palm Tree, a dingy motel towards the outskirts of Kerkard after a scary encounter that Meru and Gwen had with Dauntless. You realized that without immediate action, the members of LAKE would just try to pick you off one by one until you were too weak and paranoid to resist them.\nYou decided that information was the most important this to gather, and thanks to Meru and Jusa, something you could do without having to leave the motel room.\nJusa cast Divination twice, the first time asking\nWhere will Ambition be tomorrow morning?\nand receiving the answer\nAtop the hill in the halls of governance.\nwhich you interpreted as the Central Forum or the Delegate tower for the Principality of Vi.\nConcerned about Dauntless, a powerful foe capable of manipulating your memories and perceptions, she also asked\nWhere will Dauntless be tomorrow morning at dawn?\nand learned\nReturning from the field of dreams.\nThis one was distinctly less help, as you interpreted it as basically that Dauntless would be waking up for the day.\nRegardless, you pressed onward with Meru\u0026rsquo;s daily questions, learning among other things that Clayton Willock, the new Delegate from the Principality of Vi is a member of LAKE. You also learned that\nDaalvis Zidba, a.k.a. Freedom does not play to betray you if you attack Ambition. That Ambition was ready but not waiting for your next move. That Vessimur\u0026rsquo;s staffers are not aware of his membership in LAKE. That Vessimur will be sleeping in the Delegate tower for the Principality of Vi tonight and should still be there around dawn. Putting all of these bits of information together, the unthinkable happened: everybody agreed with Zorro. It was time to use the barrel of Cylex recovered from the Taerwyn Dock Explosion oh so long ago. You decided to strike at dawn, when Vessimur is likely to just be getting up for the morning and other staff are the most likely to be away from the tower. Using Blue Eyes to place and detonate the explosive, you plotted a bombing of the Forum not unlike the one that started this whole adventure. Zorro separates the Cylex in half, creating two 15 pound charges.\nWe now resume as you approach the Central Forum complex. Blue Eyes has just taken flight to place the bomb outside Ambition\u0026rsquo;s bedroom window. You\u0026rsquo;re located just outside the patrol lines around the building, preparing for the fight of your life.\n","date":"25 October 2023","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2023-10-25/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;","title":"Time to Crime"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;\nThe members of the Task Force where holed up in a safe-house provided to them by Rokkaku Nakateru, the propitiator of Rokkaku\u0026rsquo;s Ramen. Even though it was late into the night, you were all up discussing your actions for the next day. You eventually decide to use Sending to meet with Eaton at the Temple of Korina on Kerkard.\nFrom Task Force: Meet us at the church of Kronia at 11am, We have information for you regarding LAKE. Meet empty hands in good faith.\nEaton\u0026rsquo;s response is a single word:\nAcknowledged.\nThe next morning, Zorro, Redfern and Wil are sure to arrive at the temple early, using Wind Walk to traverse the skies and avoid being spotted around the temple until Eaton gets there. Once he arrives, a full 15 minutes early, you get down to business. They tell Eaton about discovering Vessimur Yutros\u0026rsquo; true identity as Ambition, about Oisin\u0026rsquo;s death and that you were able to recover the sword. In response, Eaton tells you that the vote to disband the Task Force and set a bounty on you was a shocking 0 - 20, which is unheard of for the Forum. He also says that the vote was taken behind closed doors and all of the questions that he\u0026rsquo;s asked to the delegates have been dismissed by them claiming \u0026ldquo;new evidence has come to light\u0026rdquo; and refusing to elaborate further, despite the fact that Eaton runs the de facto intelligence agency of the Koncord. Before leaving, Eaton says that he will support you and asks if he should prepare anything to help with your efforts. You tell him that no specific actions are required at this time.\nWith a final warning that he knows the location of the safe-house, you depart and move to a room at the Lost Palm Tree, a run-down motel in a poorer part of town. The news of the Forum\u0026rsquo;s unanimous vote to outlaw you is shocking, but Meru already has a meeting scheduled with Ikoma Sakome, one of the delegates from the Niven Imperium to see a showing of Omelet by Wilfred Mountmore at a local theater, the Icosahedron, which was arranged using Sending by Jusa.\nFrom Meru: Important news regarding new Herske - conspiracy and LAKE, defaming us. Meet at Icosahedron for Omelet tonight to discuss future - empty hands, good faith.\nTo which Ikoma relies:\nI\u0026rsquo;ll see what I can arrange.\nThe play itself is mediocre; a story about a dethroned prince seeking revenge on his uncle for the murder of his father with all together too many egg puns. Eventually Meru, with Gwen under his hat in the form of an insect, finds Ikoma and sits next to her. The two exchange pleasantries and Meru offers their condolences for the death of Ikoma\u0026rsquo;s family. Just as they are moving onto the main topic, Ambition, Meru falls asleep. While asleep, they dream of a figure in black robes with deep blue runes embroider onto it. Dauntless. Who seemed amused that Meru though they were a member of the government. They told Meru that they has been sent to remove Meru from the equation, but that it would be more challenging then normal due to Meru\u0026rsquo;s resilient mind.\nMeanwhile, Gwen has sprung into action, and at first attempted to get the attention of Ikoma before realizing that she was in a mental state similar to sleep-walking. Gwen then exchanged places with her familiar (to the confusion of the audience members) to warn the rest of you about the danger. Transposing back, Gwen disrupted the magical effect on Meru with Dispel Magic, Greater. This shunned they back into their body just as Dauntless was casting a spell, the effects of which unknown even to Meru\u0026rsquo;s trained eye.\nMeru and Gwen quickly retreated to the Lost Palm Tree to regroup with the rest of the Task Force. Realizing the power that Ambition and LAKE holds over the rest of the Forum, you resolved to act fast and make no further contact with Delegates.\nFinally, Meru explained that they believe Dauntless is an Eichen based on a vision from their first trip to Kerkard, of a figure in the sky who was looking back at Meru and clearly had a Eichen tail. Meru also realized that they knew about Bur Harcosa\u0026rsquo;s death before it happened. While processing this new information, Zorro remembered that some Eichen have stronger shape-shifting abilities then he does, but you aren\u0026rsquo;t if or how that factors into what you know about Dauntless.\nWe now resume on the 18th night of Whitermire, with you all gathered in a single dreary motel room on the out-skirts of the city.\n","date":"11 October 2023","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2023-10-11/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;","title":"A Night at the Theater"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;\nThe members of the Task Force were plotting there next move on the coast of the Commune of Atrxous. You were discussing the finer points of a revolution and how to remove the compromised actors from the Forum when a sudden slashing sound from a nearby creek caught your attention. A appeared that a group of bounty hunters where snooping around for the new bounty on your head. Their leader was a dwarf in laborers cloths that would be typical in the Commune, along with a man in a black robe with lightning bolts, what appeared to be a hunter and a dueler wearing medium armor. You weren\u0026rsquo;t interested in fighting this group, so Meru attempted to de-escalate the situation by revealing the Sword of Divinity. While the hunter and the dueler wanted to bail, the dwarf was not convinced that the sword was real and the situation did indeed escalate when the figure in robes cast Chain Lightning. Meru acted quickly, and used Rainbow Pattern to fascinate three of the four bounty hunters, everybody except their leader. After a brief struggle, he was knocked out and left in the woods after Meru cast Stabilize. They continued to concentration on the Rainbow Pattern to keep the others occupied and quickly broke camp, using a combination of Overland Flight and Wind Walk to return to Kerkrad.\nOnce back on the city, you needed a place to lie low for a while. After a quick debate, Wil re-materialized from the fog and headed for Rokkaku\u0026rsquo;s Ramen to see if he could provide a safe-house or other nondescript location. Wil, disguised as \u0026ldquo;Chad the Fogbringer\u0026rdquo; in town for the annual fog-surfing champion, ordered the Rattlesnake Ramen and asked for a safe-house location. Rokkaku delivered and with the receipt for his ramen, Wil found a street address written on it. Eventually everybody gathered and coalesced from their gaseous state in the Syndicate safe-house.\nHoping to gain an information advantage, Meru used their questions to ask about if Rokkaku was doing to betray them and surprising he wasn\u0026rsquo;t. You also learned that Eaton was not compromised by LAKE but hadn\u0026rsquo;t learned of your current whereabouts. Using Jusa\u0026rsquo;s Divination, you learned that Eaton would meet with you in good faith, Marchi Elenek would seek a safe guard, Ikoma Sakome can\u0026rsquo;t learn about your connection to the Syndicate and the Breagan would be a wild card.\nWe now resume late on the night of Whitermire 17 as you plot how to meet up with Eaton and the other members who you\u0026rsquo;ve identified as being critical for a coup.\n","date":"4 October 2023","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2023-10-04/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;","title":"Back to Home Base"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;\nThe members of the Task Force had just defeated Zealous, Nimble and Nefarious, a group of LAKE members who had presumably been tasked with guarding the Sword of Divinity. During that battle, both Oisin and Zorro were slain and you were hopeful that their deaths would be rewarded with the long-sought sword.\nThose who remained turned their attention to the laboratory itself. Using Detect Magic, Meru found a large magic source under the center of the floor. Blue Eyes gained a borrow speed and cleared the obsidian-encrusted floor while Gwen cast Create Treasure Map using Nefarious\u0026rsquo; skin and that this lab is holding the sword. Once the floor was cleared, Jusa used a Divination to ask\nHow could Meru safely retrieve the Sword of Divinity from its current place?\nand learned\nRotate the seal until the primary rune points home.\nLooking at the intricate stone platform in the center of the lab, you quickly identify the center rune as one of the most basic conjuration runes in the arcane literature. After a quick debate, you decide to point the top of the rune towards Ændor and when Gwen rotates the capstone into position and a black liquid starts to rise out of the cracks in the stone. The liquid swells, and then recedes, and reveals the Sword of Divinity.\nAlso during this time, Jusa messaged Daalvis Zidba with Sending, saying:\nFrom Friends of Oisin: Oisin is dead (maybe fixable). In lab under Isle of Ruin, Need evac ASAP. Help\nto which Daalvis responses with\nRisk to alerting Fractal and LAKE too great. Suspicion is high already. The Forum is compromised. Oisin will rise again. Long live Ændor.\nNow you were faced with task of moving a sword known for burning those who touch it in a column of holy-fire. The first of you to take the risk was Redfern, using a Mage Hand to touch the Sword.

It was easy when Meru successfully cast Color Spray, then Wil Coup de Grace\u0026rsquo;d it. Your income totaled 150,000 gp and a helm with unknown magical properties. You finally rose to the surface of the Isle of Ruin and made camp for the night, planning to revive Oisin who can then teleport everybody off the island without risking exposure to any potential LAKE spies. During the night, Jusa prepared her spells and used Raise Dead and Restoration to bring him back with one negative level. She repeated the process with Zorro\u0026rsquo;s body.\nOisin was excited to learn that the rest of the group had recovered the sword and asked to see it. Meru drew the Sword of Divinity from their bag and the ethereal outline of six angel wings appear.

Zealous proved to be a particularly difficult foe, highly resistant to magic and a melee brute. The arcs of her scythe capable of cleaving through multiple foes and critical blows that can eviscerate any of you in one hit. Naturally, the strategy to fight Zealous became to surround her with numerous summons from Redfern such as Bearded Devils and Squids. Combined with a few consecutive Channel Energy\u0026rsquo;s from Jusa and the effectiveness of the cleaves was greatly reduced. However, Zealous is not one to continue using an ineffective strategy and switched to targeting all of her damage into one target, killing them before moving to the next one. Since Zorro had charged up a Shocking Grasp and dealt 100 points of damage in his first turn engaged with Zealous, he was the first target and could not withstand the onslaught of scythe strokes, falling dead to the stone floor of the tower. While Zorro wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to soak the damage from Zealous, Gwen, through several uses of Wild Shapes (Which now that I read the ability text, I don\u0026rsquo;t actually think works in the way that the ability was used during the fight) into a Mastodon.\nWhile Zorro, Gwen and the summons where working on Zealous, Wil and Meru tag-teamed Nefarious, the sniper hiding in the window who killed Oisin. Wil pulled him out of the window and then Meru stunned him with a Color Spray, grabbed his gun and ran. After that the strategy was simple; Wil punched and kicked him until he went down.\nMeanwhile, Nimble had been fascinated behind a bookshelf by Meru, but once Meru lost concentration on the spell, he was able to recover and free himself from the Obsidian Flow that Oisin cast before his death. Afterwards his climbed onto the bookshelf to get a better view of the battlefield. In response, Redfern sent some of the summons over to harass Nimble and absorb more damage. With his view also blocked by the aforementioned mastodon, Gwen took quite a few shots from Nimble as well, including one which put her under the effects of Isolate. Nimble realized that repeatidly killing summons from Redfern wasn\u0026rsquo;t productive and moved in on the rest of the party along the Southern side of the tower. But when he did, Wil engaged him and he finally fell as well.\nWe now resume in the secret laboratory where Daalvis Zidba is researching the Sword of Divinity, although the damage of the battle is clearly visible with dead bodies on the floor, bullet holes everywhere and much of the lab floor encased in sharp obsidian.\n","date":"6 September 2023","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2023-09-06/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;","title":"Time to Talk about the (Invisible) Mastodon in the Room"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;\nThe members of the Task Force had just encountered a spherical ooze raising from a room full of debris and bone, a skeletal figure in the center of the ooze. You had tried to just go around the ooze since it wasn\u0026rsquo;t immediately hostile, but when you did the eyes of the skeletal wizard flared to life and it cast Chain Lightning at you. At the same time, a stone statue of a head in the far corner started to murmur a captivating tune which enchanted several of you. You quickly decided the best course of action was to not waste resources and attempt to move past the pair of monsters into the next chamber over. Eventually that was accomplished and a Wall of Stone erected to seal the open doorway, blocking the murmurs from following you. After proceeding through a few more mostly empty chambers, you arrive a a locked stone door. Without any of the Task Force members being particularly skilled at picking locks, Wil bashes the door down with a tremendous racket. Beyond that door is your target, a circular room exactly matching the size of the room in Oisin\u0026rsquo;s vision, with stairs leading upwards. You take the stairs into a damp but otherwise dry and clean space filled with bookshelves and a low stone platform.\nWhile you had expected the lab to be empty, with Daalvis Zidba and his aid still away for the Mage\u0026rsquo;s Guild Conference in Sino, you are instead greeted be a tall woman with feathers growing in her hair and a large snake tail that ends with more feathers. You ask were the Sword of Divinity is and she says that she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know. While skeptical of the answer, a few Sense Motive checks reveal that she really doesn\u0026rsquo;t know. Oisin is first to realize that a combat is brewing and casts Detect Thoughts to learn more about the woman standing before you and see if there are any other\u0026rsquo;s hiding in the room. He learns that there are at least two more people in the range of Detect Thoughts. When the combat starts, several things happen all at once. Oisin casts Obsidian Flow, Meru casts Rainbow Pattern and a gunshot echos through the small lab.

After a brief respite at the Rusty Lightning Bolt (the only tavern on the island), during which Oisin cast Akashic Communion. He asked to see:\nA member of LAKE entering the laboratory. He saw a circular room with a slightly raised dais in the center. Around the edges are numerous book shelves. The walls were a smooth white stone. The event of that building being built. He saw a pearly white tower stretching into the sky. The skyline was completely foreign to him, most similar to the capital of the Caerwent Empire which Oisin had seen while Scrying. Standing in front of it was a elderly wizard in a purple velvet robe cutting a golden rope in front of the tower. A wizard of the Tower of Torrents re-discovering the Tower. He sees a short figure consistent with Daalvis enter the room from the stairs leading down. There were no maps taken or records make in the vision, only a few cryptic remarks about lefts and rights and twisting tunnels. After Oisin\u0026rsquo;s divination magic, you decided to search for entrances to the underground ruins that pot-mark the surface of the island. You divide the island and each member searches a quadrant. While Meru found a few entrances with litter, Redfern found one further out with only a few mud slides leading down.\nYou descend into the maze of ruins. Zorro encounters a thunder rune after not checking a door properly, and a bit later the rest of the Task Force found a Blood Lily. This carnivorous plant sucks the blood out of its victims but was no match for Wil\u0026rsquo;s mighty fists. Later, after asking Jusa to use Dungeonsight and look for circular rooms, you encountered a small humanoid with transparent skin in a circular chamber full of gold. The creature is not happy to see you, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t become violent. Finally, you later proceed into a chamber covered in debris.

After Gwen\u0026rsquo;s familiar spotted Oisin entering the Trobreryn Arcane Academy, she switched places with it in order to catch up to Oisin. When she went to talk to him in the entrance, he wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in hearing what she had to say and cast Icy Prison on her. Soon the rest of the Task Force with flight abilities, Meru and Zorro, arrived. After each unsuccessfully attempted to dispel the block of ice, Meru pressed forward to find Oisin while Zorro freed Gwen from the ice with a few well-placed sword strikes.\nSoon you had all gathered outside the large lecture hall were the Mages\u0026rsquo; Guild Summit was taking place. The hallway was empty, so while Gwen attempted to track Oisin (no small feat given the hard stone floor), Meru opened the door and interrupted the proceedings taking place inside. This certainly garnered some amount of ill-will from the mages, but quickly revealed that Daalvis and Oisin where not in the lecture hall. Meanwhile, with the aid of a Tracking Mark Gwen was able to pick out Oisin\u0026rsquo;s tracks. They lead up another flight of stairs and to a nearby classroom. As you gathered outside the room, presumably ready to burst in, Oisin opened the door.\nFaced with a clearly angry group, Oisin raised his hands in an attempt to talk everybody down. He said that Daalvis had admitted to being involved with the thief of the sword, but also feared for his life as a member of an organization which had been twisted by new leadership. Eventually you moved into an adjacent classroom and discussed what could be done with this new information. Purposed plans included:\nLuring Daalvis Zidba, his aid (whom Oisin stated was a true believer of the current LAKE leadership) and the sword to some remote location where they could be kill the aid and seize the sword. Storming the Isle of Ruin, where the sword is being kept, and having Daalvis help them gain access and betray the rest of LAKE once they arrived. Having Oisin attempt to infiltrate the Tower of Torrents solo. This one was not overly popular with the rest of the group. Ultimately, no concrete decision was made, although plan 2 was the leading contender. Either way, it became clear that you would need a way to safely get to and from the Isle of Ruin. Oisin decided to solve this one by Scrying on Headmaster Altair Aquila and then Teleport to the small village on the Isle of Ruin which exists to support the Mage School. He was successful, earning you and way on and off the island. Meanwhile, Gwen returned to Kerkrad via wild shape and learned that Vessimur Yutros had won the Herske Election. The other important news topic from the person that she talked too was something about the destruction of the largest grain warehouse in Arendelle, which has the potential to exacerbate a nascent food shortage.

The next day, continuing to use Meru\u0026rsquo;s star chart, you learn that the Thief is currently teleporting between destinations on a cyclic pattern and will return to Sino within the week. Otherwise, not much happens as Oisin and Meru canvas the town for landmarks and rumors. You hear that recently, a student killed a professor in a graduation duel, despite a powerful artifact that prevents a lethal damage.\nThe next day, you decide to do something other than gaze at the star chart. Oisin and Meru travel to the Academy to ask some questions to the Guild Master Tarja Petr, particularly about if unusual teleportation signatures were appearing in the city. Tarja was happy to chat with Meru, but Oisin was recognized by a familiar face on his way into the meeting hall, Daalvis Zidba, the Dean of Students at the Tower of Torrents. Oisin ate lunch with Daalvis while Meru talked to Tarja and learned that Daalvis was teleporting back and forth from the Tower daily to keep the Headmaster Altair Aquila informed about the progress being made towards resolving the alotment issue between the Tower and the Academy. Basically, the Tower of Torrents was claiming that since they are within Trobreryn\u0026rsquo;s borders they were entitled to pull from the pool of Trobreryn students. However, they don\u0026rsquo;t have the facilities to teach non-arcane mages such as divine or primal casters. According to Tarja, Daalvis literally wrote the book on teleportation magic and was the only guild member returning home every night.\nAfter learning this, Meru consulted his star chart and confirmed that Daalvis was the Thief of the Sword of Divinity that you had been hunting. On the way back from the Academy, Meru told Oisin who did not take the news lightly. Oisin stormed off while Meru returned to the hotel. Meru gathered the rest of you and explained what happened.

He also detailed his security system, which was impressive.\nAll of the doors and windows have masterwork locks with Arcane Lock cast on them. The whole house is under a constant Invisibility Purge. Several glass statues in the house are actually Glass Golems who activate if any of the display pieces are touched without speaking a password first. Living paintings, which constantly monitor the room the pendant was displayed in. If any of the other systems are triggered, Guards and Wards is automatically cast on the house. All collection items are marked with Arcane Mark. And yet even with all of this security, somebody was able to gain entry to the house and take the pendant without leaving any trace of themselves. Oisin took one of Samuel Banciu\u0026rsquo;s hairs to potential scry on him or disguise himself as Sam.\nMeanwhile, the election results are it! Of the four candidates running, nobody received a majority of the votes so a run-off election will be held in two day\u0026rsquo;s time between the top two candidates, Barno Henchor from the Eichen Kingdom and Vessimur Yutros from the Principality of Vi.

Looking to get there fast, before the thief has a chance to leave town, you decided to sky-dive off of Kerkrad that night, relaying on Meru to be the beacon on the ground and Oisin to cast Feather Fall to safely deliver everybody to the ground. Fortunately, everything goes as planned and you land 3 miles from Ravencross, a small town in the Trobreryn country-side. Resting here for the night, you get set off in the morning to get to Sino using a combination of Overland Flight and Teleport to get everybody there by dinner time on Whitermire 9th.\nYou check into The Gray Owlbear Hotel and Meru gets to work talking to the numerous people in the lobby. They learn that there is a yearly submit of mages and administrators taking place in Sino right now. The most contentious issue seems to be about how student mages are allocated to the academies and towers within Trobreryn. The Tower of Torrents, arguably the most prestigious mage school in the Basin is claiming that they should have guaranteed access to students in Trobreryn since they are technically within Trobreryn. However, they don\u0026rsquo;t have the capacity to meet the requirement of all of the other Trobreryn academies since they also accept numerous applicants from outside of Trobreryn, effectiving trying to drain the top talent out of the Trobreryn Arcane Academy and it\u0026rsquo;s affiliated campuses.\nWe now resume late on the night of the 9th as you all gather around the star chart to ask the daily questions\u0026hellip;\n","date":"5 July 2023","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2023-07-05/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;","title":"Over the Edge!"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;\nRedfern\u0026rsquo;s mind was in a dream meeting with the being that erased Vicious\u0026rsquo; memories, presumably to prevent him from disclosing information to the Task Force. The being was wearing a black robe with blue runes embroidered on it. After attempting to expel Redfern from the dreamscape, they had a conversation about the ideals of the Koncord of Kieros. Why does it exist? Does it fulfill those purposes? If it was working currently, would Redfern\u0026rsquo;s parents have needed to die in a raid? Unfortunately, the conversation proved to be mote point since Redfern forgot everything that transpired just like trying to remember a dream.\nAll that he was really able to report is that the Dream Candle works and that he did talk to somebody on the other side. That was the morning of Meru\u0026rsquo;s Psychic Surgery, so he had to head off to the Wounded Solider Initiative early that morning, escorted by Wil and Oisin. The staff at the clinic asked they to remove all of their magic items to prevent any possible side-effects from the new spell. During the procedure, Meru saw their entire life with a detached sense of clarity which culminated in the Forum courtyard a few nights ago. Dr. Drache was able to restore the memory so that Meru remembered a figure with blonde, almost yellow hair, in a long brown cloak.\nOnce returning to the Task Force working room, you started to plot your next move and quickly realize that the upcoming Herske Election could foil your best laid plans. The current frontrunner, Barno Henchor, has questioned your standing as members of the Task Force investigating the missing Sword of Divinity and even introduced a resolution to limit your access to Koncord resources. While that vote failed, you thought it likely that if he were to be elected he would further limit your operation or even potentially disband the Task Force and jail you. You formulate a plan to get Marchi Elenek, the Krig of the Forum, into the Herske seat. Ever aware of the potential political ramifications, you decide to have Meru approach Ikoma Sakome, a Delegate from the Niven Imperium and known personal friend of Marchi. While she actually agrees with most of their points about the potential gains of backing Marchi and then bidding for the Krig position, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t see any way for that to happen due to her own political standings and the fact that Marchi isn\u0026rsquo;t interested in running and splitting the ticket with Barno.\nDuring this meeting, however, Ikoma suggested that even if a new Herske limited the authority of the Task Force, it might be in the best interest of the Basin as a whole to do whatever it takes to recover a symbol of international unity and potential superweapon for an invasion from the Caerwent Empire. This idea seemed to resonate with Oisin spend the rest of the day preparing to go rouge by studying locations for teleporting around the Basin without needing the teleporation circles operated by the Koncord. He also visited his contact at the Docks to confirm that Andorr Again was not behind the death of Bur Harcosa so the recent deaths in the Empire of Xylte.\nAfter returning, Meru uses their star chart to divine some more information and learns that the thief of the Sword is somewhere in Trobreryn.\nWe now resume on the morning of Whitermire 8th, the day of the Herske Election, as you weight your options depending on the outcome of the election and how to pursue the thief in Trobreryn.\n","date":"28 June

While everybody was sleeping in the work room to avoid splitting the party, Zorro had another of his recurring nightmares about his wound which lead to him being discharged from the Eichen military. This time, after the wound was inflicted, he dreamt of being on an unfamiliar operating table, the masked doctors above him talking about the procedure not going as planned and then giving him more sedative.\nIn the morning, one group goes to procure the material component for False Alibi from Elon\u0026rsquo;s Emeralds. Meanwhile, another group talks to the Forum delegates from the Commune of Atrxous to get permission to see the body of Bur Harcosa. The new delegates readily agree, and when the form is presented to Eaton, he remarks that you\u0026rsquo;ve figured out an important aspects of Forum politics and then has a guard escort that group to body of Bur.\nAfter shopping for emeralds, the group out and about heads over to the Library of the Muse to investigate magical means of restoring memories. The curator that Oisin talks to is able to produce a scroll of Psychic Surgery from the pre-print area of the archive. Just like in academia, the Library has received a submission to be added to the archives and distributed to wider audiences, but the submission hasn\u0026rsquo;t been fully reviewed. The curator is not willing to let you have the scroll, since that would leave the submission in an incomplete state when it is reviewed later, but does give you a copy of the research article associated with the new spell which fortunately includes an address on Kerkrad. The author of the paper is Dr. Diana Drache, who works at the Wounded Solider Initiative, a project originally from the Eichen Kingdom which offers aid to wounded solider and adventurers all over the Great Basin. Realizing that this organization has strong ties to the Eichen, the group decides to fetch Zorro for the conversation. Upon returning to the Forum building, Oisin is able to cast Red Hand of the Killer using the body of Bur Harcosa and dye the right hand of whomever hastened his death red. What follows is a search of the Forum building where you inspect the right hands of anybody you think might be involved with Harcosa\u0026rsquo;s death. However, you don\u0026rsquo;t find anything more than one false positive where a worker in the print shop was working with red ink.\nAfter the search, the entire Task Force goes to the address listed on the research paper to talk to Dr. Drache. The secretary goes upstairs to find her, and returns with a black-furred Eichhörnchen who is clearly blind with a lot of scarring around her eyes. Using the railing on the stairs to guide her back up, she leads you to her office to discuss your needs. She is willing to perform the operation on Meru, which will restore all lost memories, but since Meru is not a wounded veteran it will cost a few hundred gold extra. The total price, including needed spell components is 1200 gp and once you agree to find the spell components, the operation is scheduled for tomorrow morning.\nOn the way back from the Wounded Solider Initiative, you notice that some of the people on the streets seem weary of you and are whispering as you go past. Stopping in a prominent spell component shop, you pressure the worker behind the counter (who knows most of the spell casters in the party) what is going on and they tell you that there is a rumor spreading that your Task Force was involved in the death of Bur Harcosa. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t know where it started as he just heard it from other people coming into the shop, but Meru later learns that the rumor was starting magically.\nLater that night, as you all head to bed in the Task Force working room, you decide to light the dream candle after some questions from Meru to the stars reveal that it will let you reach the person whom erased Vicious\u0026rsquo; memories. When lit, you all feel drowsy and soon drift to sleep but only Redfern dreams of a dark void with seven elegant chairs illuminated from sourceless drop-lights, a figure in black robes with blue runes embroidered onto it.\nWe now resume in the mind of a dreaming Redfern as you face the figure who might have erased Vicious\u0026rsquo; memories in the inky darkness.\n","date":"23 April 2023","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2023-04-23/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;","title":"Great Basin Session (2023-04-23)"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;\nThe Task Force had just turned in Vicious to the Forum. Afterwards, Oisin had talked to Eaton about Bur Harcosa\u0026rsquo;s death and learned that it appeared to be from natural causes, but of course there are magical means to alter a body after death. They had not found any evidence of tampering, and no other evidence of foul-play either. After, but asking the stars Meru learned that Bur\u0026rsquo;s death was indeed hastened and that the person responsible was within two city blocks of the Forum building. Meru and the familiars headed to the streets to search for this perpetrator but didn\u0026rsquo;t have much luck. While there were people out and about, there were very few that Meru recognized. They did spot Steven, the Truthspeaker for Kerkard at a local restaurant, but other than that none of the other suspects were located.\nThen, while Meru was crossing the courtyard in front of the Forum building, they happened to feel the hair on the back of their neck stand up. Something was wrong. Sitting to look like they were meditating, Meru cast detect magic and noticed something with Strong magic auras. They followed it into the building at the brisk pace, but when they approached Eaton\u0026rsquo;s office suddenly all motivation was missing from their mind. They knew that Eaton\u0026rsquo;s office was not their final destination, but had no recollection of who or what they were pursuing. After a brief chat with Eaton, Meru was convinced that something was afoot and headed off in search of Oisin.\nWhen Oisin learned of what had been happening, he was also convinced they were in the midst of something suspicious. He gathered some other members of the Task Force and started a search of the area. They noticed footprints on the wet floor from where a janitor had been mopping but the janitor didn\u0026rsquo;t remember seeing anybody. Fortunately the area was a dead end and you couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any evidence that this creature had left yet. You methodically searched the limited area but weren\u0026rsquo;t able to find anything suspicious. Zorro, using Greater Detect Magic, found the lingering aura of a spell on the wall of one of the conference rooms but both he and Gwen weren\u0026rsquo;t able to identify the spell or the castor. Out of immediate leads, you asked Eaton to have some of his analyst look at the aura then regrouped to formulate form more questions for the stars. Around this time, Wil decided to check in with Vicious in the prison. Heading down to the bottom of the Forum complex he checked in with the guard, who said that nobody had ben down here since Vicious was booked. The guard escorted Wil to Vicious\u0026rsquo; cell and had to extensively rattle the bars to wake the sleeping figure. Once he woke, Vicious didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to remember anything about Wil or why he was in jail and even said that his name was Alex.\nWil quickly regrouped with everybody in the working room with the rest of the group and you decided to implement a buddy system and strict policy of writing down suspicious behavior.

After stripping him of his weapons, he was imprisoned in one if his own jail cells. While unconscious, you inventoried the Sanguine Ravager and the store rooms on the island. During this time you also talked to the fish minions, who turned out to be dull intellectually and took next to no convincing to keep them fixing their huts while Oisin had burned. Also during this time, Oisin, Meru and Gwen ventured under the lake to find the Kraken. After about an hour of searching the cramped passageways under the island, you found the kraken in a larger cavern. It introduced itself as Qwoshokk, the Consuming Tide and while it wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in letting you build a tower on the island without swearing an oath of fealty, it seemed to be rather agnostic towards Vicious now that he had been defeated.\nWhen Vicious awoke, he was willing to talk on one condition: his life. Unfortunately for him, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t something that you were interested in sparing. While one group was under the waves, Vicious told you about his early life. He started out as a deck hand for Ragnory Shipping Co and rose the ranks until he was the first mate of the Brilliant Jewel. But he found it boring and resigned to hunt kraken and sea serpents. Here he encountered Qwoshokk and spent years hunting the mighty beast. Eventually, while at Qwoshokk\u0026rsquo;s mercy, he accepted a pact to serve the kraken in him mission to destroy the surface world. As captain of the Sanguine Ravager, he become a feared pirate and mounted a raid on the Brillant Jewel, his old ship. There he fought somebody, whom he would not really identify, who killed his crew and offered to spare his live in exchange for joining a different organization, LAKE. He stopped here since he did not have the assurance of leaving the cell alive. Instead, with the clean message to leave from Qwoshokk, you took him back to Kerkard to present him to the Forum.\nUpon reaching the Forum, late on the 6th of Whitremire, you gathered the Forum and noticed that one member, Bur Harcosa was missing. Turns out that he recently died on the day that you set sail from Taerwyn. Operating without the Herske, Marchi Elenek ran the meeting and everybody seemed happy and satisfied with your progress this time. Specious of Bur\u0026rsquo;s death, Meru asked the stars for guidance and learned that his death was hastened by outside forces, that somebody on the Forum knew this but had not ordered it and that that person was within two city blocks of the Forum building.\nWe know resume in the working room of the Forum as Meru reports their findings to the rest of you.\n","date":"9 April 2023","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2023-04-09/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;","title":"Great Basin Session (2023-04-09)"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;\nIt was the 28th of Shimmerfall. After dodging numerous questions from the Forum and defeating a resolution to severely limit access to Koncord resources, you prepared to hunt Vicious, the only known member of the League Against Koncord Eminence and the slayer of Wil\u0026rsquo;s father Foalan Ragnory.\nUsing the knowledge from Niwa\u0026rsquo;s messenger, you knew that Vicious was on an island in Kratermeer. This island was supposedly enshrouded in mist and had the tendency to move around the big lake. You visited Taerwyn again so that Wil might attend his father\u0026rsquo;s funeral and so that you could charter a ship from Ragnory Shipping Co for the hunt. In negotiations with the dock master, it was agreed upon that they would charge the Koncord 3,000 gp for a voyage to an unknown location which would take an unknown number of days.\nOn the 33th of Shimmerfall, you left Taerwyn. After four days on the lake, and several major course corrections which backed the claim that the island itself moves, you awoke in a void of fog. Near the end of the day, the bow of your ship landed on a beach of gravel. Quickly scouting while the crew of the ship stayed behind, you located a massive cave, one large enough to hold a warship. So perfectly warship sized\u0026hellip; that it was housing a warship! Gwen used Spider Climb, Communal to move the party across the ceiling, avoiding a cluster of huts and humanoids with bulbous eyes, sparse hair and webbed fingers.\nYou deduced that Vicious was in the captain\u0026rsquo;s quarters and plotted an assault from the ceiling. Descending from the mast of the Sanguine Ravager you stormed the cabin! Luck was with you, or perhaps more accurately luck with was Gwen. While Meru struggled to get a successful Color Spary or Debilitating Portent, and Wil and Zorro absorbed massive amounts of damage, she was able to cast Pox Pustuals and Slowing Mud on Vicious as well as Pup Shape a kraken which was harassing Redfern\u0026rsquo;s summons from over the edge of the ship.\nEventually, Vicious fell unconscious and the fish-like people entangled themselves in a Web created by Oisin.\nWe now resume on the 4th of Shimmerfall, with an apprehended Vicious, entangled minions and a baby kraken somewhere in the depths.\n","date":"2 April 2023","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2023-04-02/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;","title":"Great Basin Session (2023-04-02)"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;\nThe Task Force, while recovering from the party in Galimatias where Breagan became part of the King\u0026rsquo;s personal guard, received news that they were to appear before The Forum to present an update on the investigation on the 28th of Shimmerfall. While preparing for this meeting, on the 26th, Wil learned that there had been an attack on the Ragnory Shipping Co headquarters which resulted in the Death of Foalan Ragnory. While distraught by the news, Wil was able to gather from Nessa Preston that the attack had one assailant with a glowing red katana. While Wil, not the sharpest tool in the shed, made several guesses about who the wearer of this blade is, he eventually agreed with Nessa that it was most likely Vicious, an undine whom you had first encountered during the Keburpemi Syndicate Evacuation of Taerwyn last month.\nUpset, Wil headed over to Rokkaku\u0026rsquo;s Ramen to see if Niwa had any information about where to find Vicious given his past history with the syndicate. Ordering the rattlesnake ramen as instructed, Will requested all information that the syndicate had about Vicious\u0026rsquo; current whereabouts. The next day, as Oisin entered his apartment for the night, he was greeted by a Niven man wearing a long leather coat with a swooping haircut streaked with blue. Oisin, unsure what to do Oisin pretended to be a neighbor in need of some sugar before dropping the act to reveal that he was a tenant of the apartment. As it turns out, the man was send by Niwa in response to Wil\u0026rsquo;s research for information about Vicious. When Wil got home a few minutes later, the man revealed that for a while, it appeared that Vicious was going to be a major playing resisting Niwa\u0026rsquo;s claim to the leadership of the syndicate so he was heavily monitored and his associates interrogated. They learned that Vicious operates from a base on an island in Kratermeer. Supposedly, the island is always wreathed in fog and moves all over the lake. However, the last associate captured by the syndicate had a compass which leads to the island. He gave the compass to Will and tells him that the syndicate would strongly support any course of action which removes Vicious as a player in the criminal spheres.\nThe next day was the 28th, when the Forum meeting was taking place. Arriving early in the morning, you were prepared for several hours of deflecting and dodging to prevent knowledge about the source of Cylex, the potential location of buyers of the explosive and the criminal connections which had been the basis of much of your success so far. The opening volley was about the Caerwent Empire, an external threat that you had encounter in Roksduens who claimed that the Basin was soon to be conquered once more. It was a move which took the Forum members by surprise, and there was both eager to learn more and disappointed that the captured solider in the Roks\u0026rsquo;s desert wasn\u0026rsquo;t returned to Kerkard for more questioning. Eventually, however, the Forum realized that there was no more information to be had and returned to the actual matter at hand. You told the Forum about some progress made in tracking the explosive used in the thief, that it is called Cylex and that you had interrupted a potential Cylex sale. Some members of the Forum, namely Barno Henchor wanted you to reveal who was buying the explosive but you stood firm. The Forum also questioned trips to the Niven Lantern Festival and Roksduens and how they were related to the investigation. Barno Henchor even proposed that they limit the Task Force\u0026rsquo;s access to Koncord resources like the teleportation network. After a passionate speech by Oisin, the vote was tallied. The resolution failed 8 - 12. However, Bur Harcosa insisted on more regular meetings between you and the Forum, specifically every two weeks. The next one will be 6 Withermire.\nWe now resume after the meeting as you prepare to leave Kerkard and hunt down Vicious, a known member of LAKE and the person who killed Wil\u0026rsquo;s father.\n","date":"19 March 2023","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2023-03-19/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;","title":"Great Basin Session (2023-03-19)"},{"content":" Editor\u0026rsquo;s Note: This session was short and full of diversions, mainly do to the DM recovering from surgery and not having time to prepare material, although several other players had minor aliments as well.\nWhen we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;\nThe Task Force had just returned to Kerkard from the Roksduens there they had defeated a solider of the Caerwent Empire and reclaimed some valuable adamantine arms and armor. Almost immediately upon returning to the city above, Wil paid Oisin to make him a Large (with a capital \u0026lsquo;L\u0026rsquo;) lad permanently. The recovery of the adamantine armaments proved especially useful to Breagan, who realized that she could use these pieces to gain entry to the Lato, the personal guards of the King of Galimatias, Bennett James.\nMidday on Shimmerfall 21st, Breagan formally joined the Lato in a ceremony presided over by the King, Queen, Prince and the rest of the Lato. After which there was a mighty feast full of excellent food and fine sprits (as in alcohol, NOT undead which would be near-instantly destroyed with extreme prejudice in Galimatias).

After an hour or two, the prisoner awoke but refused to talk until the full Task Force was assembled the next morning.\nOnce bound upright to a chair, you learned that he is capable of speaking a language which is similar enough to Common to communicate, despite the thick accent and archaic vocabulary. During a combative conversation, you learned that there is another power outside the Basin, the Caerwent Empire, which occupied this land before The Shattering. Using some divination magic, namely Open Book and Detect Thoughts, Oisin learned that the Caerwent Empire has at least one city of immense proportions with more people and magical power than anything in the Basin. This solider of the Empire is a fervent believer in the power of his nation and that eventually the armies of the Empire will roll over the Basin and subjugate it once more.\nYou also learned that this Empire has a strict order and sense of honor. The solider would not be able to return to the Empire without being executed since he had failed to beat all of the forces that he had encounter in the Basin.\nRedfern saved the Empire the trouble by executing the solider in two blows. You decided to split the party, with Oisin, Breagan, Wil and Meru teleporting back to the teleportation circle near Tomo while the rest of the group trekked back by foot. However, the trek itself was not a gentle scroll through the dessert. On the second day during a break, a Purple Worm attacked. It erupted from the sands and quickly grabbed Gwen and swallowed her. While struggling with the powerful constriction and acid of the stomach, she managed to cast Pup Shape and transform the worm into a small, baby worm which caused her to be spat out.\nThe baby worm was still powerful, but with a heavily reduced number of hit points it was slain without issue.

Once you reached Tomo, the closest thing to a capital of the Roksduens, you sought out Hibiscian Saffren, the elder of the Tomo tribe.\nUpon entering the town hall, which also serves a number of other purposes ranging from tavern, inn, courthouse and legislature, you were approached by a young man a who told Redfern to cover his face and follow. He then lead you to behind a curtain in the rear of the hall, where Elder Hibiscian Saffren sat. He started by giving Redfern a warning; he had been outlawed upon leaving the Roks, meaning that any crime could be committed against him and he was outside any aid from the Roks.\nHe also assumed that your current appearance was about the devastating raid on the Calchiroos Tribe over a week ago. He told you that judging from where the black plumes of smoke were coming from, the raider band was moving south and attacking every nomad caravan they encountered.\nAfter the meeting, Redfern borrowed Wil\u0026rsquo;s hat of disguise to remain unnoticed. At the market, you tracked down a merchant selling and renting camels to see about getting a guide for the desert journey ahead of you. The camel merchant told you that most of the local guides aren\u0026rsquo;t willing to approach such an obvious threat as the raider band, but that a non-local wanderer who seemed familiar with the desert came through recently and that she might be willing to risk both the heat of the desert and the threat of the raiders. A brief search later, you tracked down a drow druid named Guinevere in the tavern section of the town hall. Oisin was certainly surprised to be face-to-face with a type of elf which he had only heard of in myth and folklore. Guinevere did agree to guide the group and you set off the next morning.\nAt of the end of two days trekking through the desert, you caught with the raiding party just after they had attacked a small caravan and where starting to load the supplies. With a frighteningly effective blitz tactic, you launched an attack on the unwitting raiding party. Opening with a powerful Firefall, Oisin caused all but the leaders of the party to be blinded for five rounds. Given the numbers disadvantage, this was a combat changing move that dramatically reduced the number of active threats. Other highlights include:\nThe figure in armor nearly shattering Breagan\u0026rsquo;s sword with a powerful Sunder. An enlarged Wil dealing approximately eighty points of damage in a single turn. Meru doing the wiggle to cause the enemy bloodrager to become shaken. The figure in armor quickly being knocked unconscious thanks to the focus of Breagan and Wil.

Despite this, one of their own and a representative to the Koncord, Daimyo Ikoma, claimed to have seen Adobaizā Aoi lead you into a conference room before dismissing her against her protests. In reality, it was Niwa disguised as the Adobaizā. The Niven government wants to keep a closer eye on you, which is difficult considering the amount of borders you regularly cross. Their solution is to appoint a member to the Task Force directly who will be able to report anything suspicious back to them. Niwa also explained that she does not have the political power to select who the new member would be, but does have enough to nominate somebody for consideration.\nAfter a brief debate, you decided that Meru should be nominated for the position. Niwa also mentioned that if you need to get in contact with her in the future, visit Rokkaku\u0026rsquo;s Ramen on Kerkrad and order the Rattlesnake Ramen.\nWent the Task Force tried to teleport back to Kerkard, you were detained momentarily by Niven Castle Guards and talked to both the Koncord representatives and the Adobaizā, who was confused by your story of her teleporting you all into the middle of the wilderness.

Several days ago, in Roksduens, a massive raiding party wiped out Calchiroos Tribe by razing their central city. Preliminary reports mentioned a figure wearing refined metal armor and with a sword and shield, the first time such a figure has been reported with a raiding party. The shield had a hammer and laurels engraved on it. Later, during several days of crafting and downtime, you also learned that\nAfter news of the destruction in Roksduens, the Eichen Kingdom has announced that it will increase the upper age limit for conscription into it\u0026rsquo;s armed forces to 30 and plans to grow the total number of active duty soldiers by 50,000 across all divisions of its armed forces.

The avatars possessed powerful abilities including extremely high displacement, gaze attacks and scream which chills you to the bone, even in the extreme heat of the volcano.

Zorro used Floating Disk to levitate Breagan, equipped with the life-stealing katana Raifusutīrā, to within striking range of Keburipemi.\nThe traditional slashing strikes proved unable to find purchase on the thick hide of the elder dragon until Breagan finally hefted the sword above her head and slammed it down in a stabbing motion. The dragon strained against the pull of the sword, but his body turned to smoke and was sucked in regardless. Saved only by the floating disk, Breagan quickly retreated to the shore of the lava lake just as the lava itself realized that the dragon was gone and collapsed inward on itself, spraying you all. It was this final splash of lava which did Redfern in, the rest of you carrying his body out of the volcano.\nA safe distance from the monastery, you stopped for a break and Niwa demanded the sword immediately.

In quick succession, Obsidian Flow and Firefall caused most of the task force to become bound, blind and burning. Amidst the chaos, Oisin\u0026rsquo;s body fell to the floor from the ceiling.\nWith both sides reeling from the effects of Firefall (including the monks who were all hit with friendly fire and blinded themselves), Niwa struck down one of the sages.

After reaching the monastery which Niwa lead you to, a lengthy discussion ensued about the best way to enter the temple. You were not keen about using the 15-foot tall double doors but did not see any auxiliary entrances. After extensive debate, it was decided that you would enter on the second floor of the pagoda, which appeared to be a barracks or communal sleeping quarters for the monks. You searched the temple from the second floor up, finding a sage and three monks on the third floor, which challenged your right to be there. Oisin attempted to gaslight them into thinking that you were on a tour of the temple, but he did not believe you. When trying to climb the stairs to the next level, the sage caused a minor earthquake which while noticeable, was not strong enough to knock anybody from their feet. Here the newest addition to the group, Meru, proved useful. A quick casting of Color Spray knocked three of the four unconscious and the last standing monk was quickly assassinated by Niwa. The rest of the group was then killed while unconscious before the group moved up to the fourth level, which appeared to be storage. You quickly ransacked the floor before checking the fifth floor, a belfry with several meditation locations, one in each of the cardinal directions. It appeared that you would have to visit the first floor, which Jusa had previously reported had several monks and a hazy atomsphere from many braziers burning.\nBefore heading to the first floor, you returned to the third floor and Niwa assumed the appearance of the dead sage. On the second floor, you found a kitchen, broom closet and wash room. Oisin opened all of the barrels of water, hoping to use the old \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rsquo;s a leak upstairs\u0026rdquo; distraction. Finally, everybody descended to the first floor, a massive open space marked with a grid of columns. As Jusa had reported, numerous braziers and sconces created a smoky space and you saw five more monks and two wearing sage\u0026rsquo;s robes. Niwa attempted the bluff the sages into believing that you were part of a tour group, but when the sages pointed out that there are never tours of the temple and they did not see you enter through the main doors, the bluff started to go sideways.\nOne of the sages cast Haste on four of the monks and growled \u0026ldquo;Get \u0026rsquo;em boys\u0026rdquo;, launching the task force into combat. Interestingly, on their first turn the monks did not engage, instead performing some form of rhythmic dance which created a tremor knocking some chucks of masonry off the ceiling. The first sage cast Obsidian Flow, entangling most of the party and dealing a respectable amount of damage. With no regard for friendly fire, the second sage cast Firefall, targeting the brazier closest to you. While it also hit all of the monks and the other sage, they were all about to weather the fire damage. However, the brilliant explosion and streaks of fire caused by the spell temporarily blinded most of the monks and many of you. The blast was even large enough to reach the ceiling, knocking Oisin unconscious and dislodging him from his high post, the fall damage killing him.\nWe now resume with most of the party entangled in the obsidian, blinded and actively on fire. Oisin is dead and the rest of the task force is struggling for hit points, even with some healing from Jusa. While the monks where burned by the Firefall, they are all still standing and rapidly recovering.\n","date":"8 January 2023","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2023-01-08/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;","title":"Great Basin Session (2023-01-08)"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin,\nIt still the 10th of Shimmerfall. After successfully stealing the life-stealing katana, Raifusutīrā, and meeting Niwa she used a bottle filled with gray liquid to transport the Task Force and herself into a remote part of the Niven forest. When asked if you would like to rest, you decided to push forward.\nEventually the party encountered a large gate marking the treeline on a trek up a mountain. As you approached, the spectral form of a suite of armor materialized and challenged you. It claimed that your reason for climbing the mountain was to upset the balance of nature and \u0026ldquo;was not a just cause\u0026rdquo;. After a brief conversation which quickly stalled, Niwa signaled to Oisin that it was time to take out the armor and pass by force.\nThe fight that ensued was not a typical combat. Because the you had elected not to rest before climbing the mountain, the spellcasters were critically low on spells and everybody was low on consumable class resources. The fighting was tough, the spectral armor aided by two statues flanking the gate. Notable moments in the fight included:\nRedfern summoning a giant scorpion and it immediately getting killed by the armor. Oisin creating the illusion of a solid rock wall filling the gate and creating a barrier to pass though. Breagan refusing to fight, instead just maneuvering to the other side of the illusionary wall and waiting for the rest of the task force to cross through. After the fight, everybody was eager to rest. Moving about an hour past the gate, a suitable camp site was selected. During the first watch shift, a new figure approached, accosting Wil with a simple and poignant \u0026ldquo;Hello Wil\u0026rdquo;. They were wearing a cloak of vibrant, glowing constellations over traditional Niven gear and levitating a few inches above the ground. They also carried an empty katana scabbard and a large farmer\u0026rsquo;s hat. Introducing themselves as Meru, they explained that they had seem the faces of the Task Force and this location written in the stars and decided to come assist in their goal of upsetting the leadership of the Keburipemi Syndicate. After some tense discussions with Niwa and the rest of the Task Force, it was decided that Meru would join them for at least this mission.\nThe next morning, with everybody rested, you set out again with a clearer idea of your mission. Niwa had explained overnight that Keburipemi was chained in the caldera of an active volcano which had a monastery designed to guard the imprisoned god. She was unsure if the monastery had been compromised by the sinister influence of Keburipemi, but even if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the monks would not allow outsiders to see the deity so heavy resistance should be expected. During this time, Breagan learned for the first time about the mission and while everybody thought she was going to oppose it, she actually approved of slaying one of the most evil and active deities in the Niven Imperium. We resume with all of you assembled outside the massive, heavy brass doors of a large monastery which is slightly recessed into the mountain.\n","date":"4 December 2022","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2022-12-04/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin,","title":"Great Basin Session (2022-12-04)"},{"content":" The Shattering # Nearly 1,800 years ago, a new star appeared in the sky over a land we know frighteningly little about.

The government of the Duchy is centered around the Duke and Duchess, currently Leto and Jessica Atreides. There capital city of Caladan is not opulent like some other capital cities, but it is very welcoming. That describes the Atreides people well, not the wealthiest, but very generous and sharing with others. They are one of the first to offer assistance to other kingdoms and because of this are generally well liked by the other members of the Koncord.\nGovernment Structure # The title of Duke is hereditary, pasted from parents to the eldest child through the generations. The Duke and Duchess serve as the executive seat of power, directing the military and negotiating with the other kingdoms. Laws are enforced by the Duke and Duchess but passed by the Landsraad, a legislature consisting of representatives from towns and cities of the Duchy with a set number of representatives per population bracket.

Violating the contract is impossible, enforced via enchantment magic and the transmutation of the valuable to the worthless.\nGovernment Structure # Formally speaking, there is no structure to the government since there is effectively no government.

After stripping Ændor of its legal protection, the army of Xylte invaded, burning the small nation nearly to the ground.

The Imperium is also known to be the only government with several settlements on the outer flanks of the boundary ridge of the Basin.\nGovernment Structure # The Imperium is ruled by an Emperor, who has absolute power but rarely uses it. Most of the daily administration of the Imperium is facilitated between military leader, the Shogun and the primary advisor to the Emperor, who uses the title of Adobaizā.\nPlaces # Capital City: Daitoshi - An absolutely massive city rife with vice and violence under the less than watchful personal guard of the Emperor. Secondary Cities: Machi - Smaller and located deep in the mountains, Machi started as a research station working with rare mountain ores but has since grown into a large alpine city. It is still home to the Machi Laboratories, a renowned research facility that seems to be in decline, overtaken by newer facilities in other kingdoms. Mura - Smaller than even Machi, Mura is the agricultural hub of the empire, where farmers come from the fertile plains below the mountains to sell goods up the main trade route to Daitoshi and Machi.

Roksduens # In the east of the Great Basin lies a desert and a constant struggle for survival. Raids from savages outside the Basin make the harsh life here even harder. Due the extreme nature of Roksduens, their formal government is limited and most of their cultural practices are designed to help them survive the extreme environment. One such example utilizes a unique type of creatures called ediolons which bond with a particular summoner. The summoners frequently have duels between ediolons as training for the raids that are sure to follow.\nGovernment Structure # There are six tribes that comprise the Roksduens,\nTomo: Located in the center of the Roksduens, this tribe is the closest that the Roks have to a trade hub and because of that one of the only ones who can organize things across tribes. Tema: Run over out of a large village on the Western border of Roksduens. This is the only place information gets into or out of the Roksduens, making it a critically important among the otherwise ignorant Roks. Kuraab: South of the deserts are some rain forests, and in the rain forests are the hunter gatherer tribe of Kuraab, harvesting exotic plants from forests. Kricrem: In the northern parts of Roksduens the rolling hills start to give away to mountains and here lie the Kricrem tribe. The Kricrem are focused on innovation and artifice, but despite their hard work the raids destroy most of their progress. Calchiroos: Sitting on the Eastern border of Roks, the Calchiroos tribe is beaten each and every day, either by the harsh desert or the near constant raids.

The result was the Koncord of Kieros, a diplomatic forum where the nations could discuss their grievances and seek redress without resorting to war. Interestingly, there is no founding document for the Koncord, merely fragments of Kieros\u0026rsquo;s journal and centuries of tradition.\nThe ruling council of the Koncord is called the Forum, composed of two delegates from each nation. The powers of the Forum are intentionally ill defined and wide ranging. Anything to prevent a war within the basin. The Forum operates on a system of resolutions and grievances. Resolutions are non-enforceable decrees that all members should follow, while grievances are allegations of wrong doing filed be a plaintiff against a respondent. Resolutions can to anything from mandate the market price of goods or add and remove members from the council. Grievances have been used to stop executions of high value political prisoners, expose spies or do things as petty as force a kingdom to take down unflattering artwork of another kingdom’s ruler.\nIf no resolutions or grievances have been filled about a topic, then the Koncord has no official stance on it and anything goes. The few times it has become an issue, the Forum’s parliamentarian has ruled that resolutions are binding across multiple instances of an issue but grievances are never binding outside of their original context, however they can be argued as precedent in future rulings on any issue.\nKerkard # Clearly whichever government hosted the Forum meetings would have considerably more power over the meeting than the rest. A neutral location was needed and the heart of Xylte was still floating above the basin. A meeting place was soon established on top of this massive piece of floating rock and over the years developed into a large city. It is a mixing pot of people and good from all over the Basin.\nForum Delegates # There are twenty forum delegates and five spacial roles.\nHerske: The formal head of the Forum, equivalent to a Prime Minister. They control the schedule for the Forum and are also the tie-breaking vote. Krig: The military leader and coordinator for all joint military operations that the Koncord conducts. Regler: The parliamentarian who maintains the rules and protocols of the Forum. Viden: Scientific and arcane liaison, required to oversee research that the Koncord funds and track recent developments by the arcane schools of the Basin.

This sword was on Xylte when the first explorers managed to let back to the floating asteroid and was wielded by Kieros herself during her heroic effort to save the Basin.\nA task force was created to recover the sword, and the player characters were selected to serve on that Task Force.\nA chronicle of the activities of the Task Force can be found on this website.

A search reveals a large fire burning in Taerwyn, the capital of Trobreryn which is near where Kerkard is floating. During the following days, the task force uncovers evidence that the explosion was caused by the same explosive which was found at the site of the Forum bombing. Not only that, but also that the explosive was distributed by the Keburipemi Syndicate, a large organized crime group from the Niven Imperium.\nWhile infiltrating a Keburipemi safe house, the task force meets Niwa, an evidently high ranking member of the syndicate looking to embarrass the one running the Taerwyn operation, an undine named Vicious.\n22 Fireharvest 1763: Using the evacuation plans leaked by Niwa, the Task Force collaborates with the Taerwyn guard lead by Nessa Preston to apprehend them. The resulting operation is mostly a success, capturing the boat and a substantial amount of drugs. While Vicious managed to escape, his underling Voracious was captured.\n28 Fireharvest 1763: A packet of documents comes into the procession of the Task Force, a letter from Niwa explaining more of the details of the explosive, called Cylex, and how they were going to sell it to a group in the Eichen Kingdom.\n32 Fireharvest 1763: The rescheduled sale of the Cylex takes place in Daquin, a small town in Trobreryn. Thanks to the heads up from Niwa, the Task Force is able to intercept both parties and apprehend the 30 pound barrel of Cylex. The leader of the Eichen delegation, Marius Kleinheisterkamp is captured.\n33 Fireharvest 1763: During an interrogation with Marius (who has been rendered blind by Oisin), the task force learns about a group of disenchanted Eichen wounded veterans who believe that the government is conducting experiments on their soldiers. When Zorro and his sword learn about this later, the sword dominates Zorro and attempts to Coup de Grâce a bound Marius. He is unsuccessful thanks to quick intervention by Oisin, Redfern and Breagan.\n03 Shimmerfall 1763: After several days of travel, the Task Force arrives back in Kerkard and books Marius and a lackey from the Syndicate into the prison their.\n04 Shimmerfall 1763: While Oisin and Breagan are attending the Annual Symposium of Arcane Masters, the rest of the Task Force interrogates Voracious. He seeks willing to talk and reveals that he and Vicious where once pirates on a ship called the Sanguine Ravager and that Vicious is a member of the group which stole the Sword of Divinity, a group called the League Against Koncord Eminence before his prison cell is flooded with negative energy and he dies. When Eaton, the investigative head of the Bastion of the Sky, tries to investigate Voracious\u0026rsquo;s death, the Task Force refuses to answer question except those from the Forum, forcing Eaton to call an emergency Forum session. At said session, the members of the Forum pressed the Task Force for answer, and they likewise refused to answer specifics, threatening to reveal dirty secrets on each government who threatened them again. The Delegates decided not press further.\n07 Shimmerfall 1763: Steven Hetzler, the truthspeaker of Kerkard, leaks that the Sword of Divinity has been stolen during bombing. However, the task force was not metioned.\n10 Shimmerfall 1763: The Task Force attends the Niven Lantern Festival under the guidance of Delegate Ikoma.

After a conversation with the owner of the Midnight Lotus, Takayama, the party believed that Niwa wanted them steal Raifusutīrā, the life stealing katana. Their mission was further complicated by realizing that Ikoma would be their chaperon for the night.\nTo start, the members asked for a tour of the Palace. While Ikoma didn\u0026rsquo;t lead you into a room titled \u0026ldquo;Super Powerful Artifact Storage\u0026rdquo;, you did note several staircases leading down, which is where Takayama mentioned the artifacts could be found. After the tour, while enjoying some nice food, Zorro was the first to enter the sparring rink with member of the Niven military. Unfortunately, he did not feel comfortable wielding the Niven wooden katana and didn\u0026rsquo;t advance out of the first round. Later, however, Wil and Blue Eyes both advanced out of the first round, using various class abilities to gain proficiency with weapon.\nAs the rest of the party, minus Breagan, foundered to create a plan, Wil and Blue Eyes continued to advance in the tournament. Wil was eliminated by a Daimyo, but Blue Eyes managed to defeat a Daimyo and advance to face the Emperor of the Niven Imperium.\nMeanwhile, Jusa was using her Remote Viewing ability to probe the basement for the location of an artifact vault. While the rest of the party was engaged with the fight between Blue Eyes and the Emperor, Oisin, Zorro and Jusa slipped down a staircase. Using Adjustable Disguise, Oisin disguised himself to look like Ikoma and convinced the guards to let him pass. Once the vault had been located, Oisin used Knock to open the door to the vault. Inside the vault, you saw seven artifacts, one on each side of an octagonal room.\nAn average looking katana. A clockwork cube. A jawbone tied to a leather chord. A shard of silvery metal. A large iridescent gemstone. A rusty ring. A glass orb with a heavy bronze sheen. Opening the glass compartment triggered a spring loaded dart which struck Oisin. Fortunately some quick first aid prevented the poison on the dart from taking affect. Inside the container was a holographic projector which hide the physical katana from being displayed. While the room itself was a powerful anti-magic field specialized to suppress artifact level items, so upon leaving Oisin slid the weapon into his bag. When the group arrived back at the courtyard, the corpse of a Daimyo lay next to the sparring ring. Naturally the palace was locked down pending an investigation. After about an hour, the Adobaizā, a special advisor to the Emperor and spiritual leader, called the task force and Ikoma to a conference room in the Palace. She dismissed Ikoma quickly, despite her protests, and then revealed herself to be Niwa, pulling what almost looked like a mask off as she rose to full height. After confirming that they had the item she needed, she simply stated that she still needed your help and pulled out a bottom of gray liquid and smashed it, teleporting the task force into the middle of the forest. When Niwa asked if you needed rest, you decided to push forward.\nAfter four hours of walking, we resume at a spirit gate where you have been challenged by a suite of spiritual armor. It did not seem keen on letting you pass, insisting that your quest was going to disrupt the flow of nature. It also hinted to Breagan that the task force had been keeping her in the dark.\n","date":"13 November 2022","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2022-11-13/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin,","title":"Great Basin Session (2022-11-13)"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin,\nIt was the 5th of Shimmerfall, 1763 and the members of the task force had just had an emergency meeting with the Forum, which did not end well.\nAfter a day of downtime, you started to look towards the next thing on your agenda, the Niven Lantern Festival as well as the creation of more magic items using the funds recovered from the bottom of the canal in Daquin. During this time, Dr. Luna announced that one of her research grants with the Arendelle government was approved, and that she would be leaving the task force to peruse that. The Arendelle form delegates said that they would be searching for a replacement member but did not have any candidates in mind at the moment.\nWil travled back to Taerwyn to talk to his father Foalan Ragnory about the Sanguine Ravager. He learned that during its last attack it sunk the Brilliant Jewel, which was the flagship of the Ragnory trading fleet and that the most unusual thing that it was carrying was a small parcel under contract from the Church of the Principality of Vi and the shipping route was from the Commune of Atrxous back to the Principality. He does not know that the item was, only that it weighted about 1 pound and that the Church of Kroina paid 500,000 gold pieces to transport it.\nOn the 7th, news finally broke that the Sword of Divinity had been stolen. The Truthspeaker for Kerkard, Steven Hertzler, announced its disappearance to the assembled crowd waiting for the daily news. While he was correct that the sword had been stolen during the bombing of the Founder\u0026rsquo;s Gala two months ago, that appeared to the the extent of his knowledge, and he did not mention the task force, any of your work or the League Against Koncord Eminence.\nOisin wanted to know how he learned of this information, and attempted to use detect thoughts and suggestion to get Steven to reveal his source, but neither were successful. He then sulked into an ally to use Akashic Communion to learn how Steven found out about the sword. In the reflections of his mirror, he saw a face with a black mask over the eyes and nose, two figures outlined by a fireplace and a parchment letter slipped into a front pocket.\nHe also asked where Vicious was an saw a plume of steam, a body in a hot spring and the entrance of a cave, visible on a small island over rough blue surf.\nOn the eighth, you traveled to Daitoshi, the capital of the Niven Imperium for the first time to find the Midnight Lotus and talk to Takayama as directed by Niwa in her letter. Takayama is an old Niven man and excellent tailor who was able to get everyone a fine silken kimono for 250 gp and a spacial order for Blue Eyes which will be ready on 13 Shimmerfall. While fitting everybody, he talked extensively about the history of the Imperium and a collection of artifacts from before the shattering that are housed inside the palace. In particular, he mentioned Raifusutīrā, the life stealing katana, multiple times before talking about how much it would mean to Niwa if you would help her change the leadership of the Syndicate.\nAfter two more days of downtime, on the night of the 10th, you assembled in the courtyard of the Forum to attend the Lantern Festival. When greeted by Ikoma, the Niven forum delegate whom gave permission for you to attend in the first place, she revealed that after the outburst in the Forum on the 4th her government felt that you needed extra supervision and placed her personally responsible for you.\nWe now resume in the courtyard of the Imperial Palace, a large square space with two rows of cherry trees, a large koi pond and small stream running through it. Around the edges are food vendors and a stage has been erected at the far end where various performing arts groups can be seen preparing for their performances. In the center of the courtyard is a sparring ring.\n","date":"6 November 2022","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2022-11-06/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin,","title":"Great Basin Session (2022-11-06)"},{"content":" This post is back dated from 7 Nov 2022 since I apparently forgot to write it.\nWhen we last ventured to the Great Basin,\nIt was the 4th of Shimmerfall 1763 and the Annual Symposium of Arcane Masters was taking place on Kerkard, an event that Oisin had been looking forward to for some time. He and Breagan went to the Symposium, hosting in the Library of the Muse and learned all sorts of new and interesting things about magic. Established practitioners were giving lectures about the schools of magic while military researchers were showing footage of the destruction of a mountain using a new technique to cast extremely powerful spells using multiple casters and some really crazy theorists were trying to impose a level system on spells. The day 1 keynote speech was given by Janus Brutus from the Empire of Xylte about countering and \u0026ldquo;decomposing\u0026rdquo; Andorran magic.\nAmong the other characters that Oisin and Breagan got to meet was Altair Aquila, the headmaster of the Tower of Torrents (the most prestigious mage school in the Basin) and the Dean of Student, a gnome named Daalvis Zidba. Both of whom seemed to enjoy speaking with Oisin in Andorran. They also met Viven Vi, the next in line for the throne of the Principality of Vi and apparently a sorcerer by birth who has not been able to escape prosecution from the Church.\nMeanwhile, the rest of you went to interrogate Voracious who was much more willing to talk than expected. He seemed to want to share some of this information. Some important things which were learned include:\nVoracious was a backup \u0026lsquo;getaway driver\u0026rsquo; for the group which stole the Sword of Divinity. He and Vicious used to be crew mates on a pirate ship called the Sanguine Ravager before getting involved with the Keburipemi Syndicate. Vicious was the one who instructed him to contact Hans about the sale of Cylex to the Eichen. The group which stole the Sword of Divinity was separate from Syndicate and is called the League Against Koncord Eminence. At this point, he started violently choking and an aura of dread quickly permeated the cell as everybody backed away from Voracious. Even Jusa did not want to approach Voracious as he collapsed on the floor, claiming that this amount of damage was beyond her capabilities. Using Greater Detect Magic, Zorro was able to learn that this effect gave off a Strong aura and was able to identify the caster\u0026rsquo;s residuals in the spell\u0026rsquo;s energy. Working with Jusa, they deduced that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t so much a spell, which implies some control of the energy, as it was channeling massive amounts of raw negative energy into Voracious.\nWhen security was called, the task force was taken into a holding room until Eaton appeared to question them. He was most unhappy when you refused to reveal the information that Voracious had been told and when you mentioned that it could only be revealed to the Forum, he called an emergency meeting of the Forum.\nDuring this emergency meeting, the delegates demanded answers, and you did your best to insist that revealing that information without proper consideration would damage the relationship between the members of the Forum. Such complains fell on deaf ears, which Barno Henchor from the Eichen Kingdom even suggesting executing the non-complainant members of the task force. At this point, Oisin stepped in and in a passionate yet blunt speech threatened to reveal secrets from each government present when had a chilling effect on the room and the delegates backed off for now.\nLater, Wil sought out Peric Abell to learn more about the Sanguine Ravager and learned that it was an infamous pirate ship which appeared 17 years ago, plundered more goods than any other ship on record and tried to unify all of the pirate fleets before disappearing, presumably lost, during a massive attack against a convey of ships operated by Ragnory Shipping Co.\n","date":"30 October 2022","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2022-10-30/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"This post is back dated from 7 Nov 2022 since I apparently forgot to write it.","title":"Great Basin Session (2022-10-30)"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;\nIt was the 33rd of Fireharvest and the members of the task force had captured Marius Kleinheisterkamp and a member of the Keburipemi Syndicate after successfully taking control of the shipment of Cylex and collecting 84,000 gold from the bottom of the channel. Through collective rationale, it was decided that it was too dangerous to take these prisoners back to Kerkrad since their members of their governments could influence or disrupt the interrogation process.\nThe next morning, with Wil absent, the rest of the part formulates questions for Marius including:\nDid you bomb the Forum on the 34th of Goldwave? What were your plans for the Cylex? How did you know about the Cylex? Who is Hans and where can we find him? Though a pained interrogation conducted by Oisin, the task forced learned that Marius and his group did not bomb the Forum last month. They were contacted by the Syndicate about if they would be interested in purchasing the Cylex by somebody with a moniker starting with a \u0026lsquo;V\u0026rsquo;. Marius claimed that the Cylex was going to be used solely within the Eichen Kingdom and for purposes not related to the task force\u0026rsquo;s investigation.\nWhen the conversation turned to his own political ideas, Marius was must more open. He revealed that he was injured during a covert operation in the Commune of Atrxous by an explosive that he had personally set and checked. After many months of recovery, he was discharged from the Eichen military and returned to investigate the explosion in the Commune. While it was difficult work, eventually he concluded that the only explanation was deliberate sabotage by someone with extensive training in Eichen explosives.\nDisheartened, he returned to the Kingdom and started talking with other wounded veterans from the Eichen military and got connected to a similar group. When they examined the office reports about the injuries released by the government, the numbers simply did not add up with what their experiences on the streets said, so they organized and launched an investigation into this manner.\nEventually, deep in the forest, a group of mages reported a strong feeling of death and intense necrotic magic which \u0026ldquo;felt like the souls of the damned fleeing the area\u0026rdquo;. Several more months of reconnaissance helped the group pin down the location of a secret research facility, underground and heavily fortified. They were going to use the Cylex to blow in a secondary entrance and try to take the compound by force.\nHe also said that Hans was his boss and revealed the location of 37 hideouts that Hans has set up.\nThe Syndicate prisoner didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal much information, other than the name of his supervisor, Bito Takamitsu. He evidently was a low level drug pusher for the Syndicate and knew nothing about the higher level plans.\nLater, when Zorro returned, Oisin mentioned that Marius wanted to discuss something with him, so he and Zorro went back into the room where Marius was bound. Marius started asking some though-provoking questions about Zorro\u0026rsquo;s injuries and his observations about the number of wounded veterans in the Kingdom. However, when he mentioned using the Cylex to bomb a government research site, Zorro\u0026rsquo;s sword was engaged and successfully dominated Zorro\u0026rsquo;s personality in an attempt to kill Marius. Oisin immediately noticed the change in Zorro and quickly called for Wil while using Color Spray to stun Zorro. While Wil was able to get into the room and grapple Zorro, it was Redfern who proved the most useful in apprehending the sword. He summoned a group of monkeys who swarmed Zorro and disarmed him by taking the sword right out of his hands. While the monkeys were then overpowered by the will of the sword, Redfern simply dismissed them, allowing Breagan to pick up the sword and place it in Oisin\u0026rsquo;s bag of holding.\nAfter that eventful morning, the group packed up and set out back to Kerkrad, using the wagon from Syndicate and their horses which Redfern thankfully didn\u0026rsquo;t kill.\nAfter arriving back at Kerkrad on Shimmerfall 3rd, you checked your prisoners into the Eaton.\n","date":"23 October 2022","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2022-10-23/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;","title":"Great Basin Session (2022-10-23)"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin:\nIt was the 32nd of Fireharvest. The members of the Task Force had gotten tickets to the Niven Lantern Festival through a at times tense conversation between Marchi Elenek. Having prepared the day before with the other members of the Task Force, Zorro decided to take a three step approach.\nAsk nicely. Positive reward, reveal that the Task Force knows of a threat related to the event. Negative reward, leak that the Niven Imperium had created and subsequently lost control over Cylex. As expected, asking nicely wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough to overcome the hesitancy of Ikoma. When Zorro moved to step 2, he was likewise meant with some resistance. Ikoma thanked him for the tip and stated that the Niven security forces would be able to handle any threats. She also mentioned that she thought that the leadership within the Imperium was far too relaxed on the Keburipemi Syndicate. However, she still seems hesitant to invite the Task Force. Zorro made an abrupt comment about the source of the explosive which seemed to catch Ikoma off guard before a helpful telepathic suggestion from Oisin in the next room reminded Zorro that the Task Force has the authority to go places and talk to people that it deems are related to the investigation. Reluctantly, Ikoma agreed to invite the Task Force on the condition that an escort be posted for them.\nAfter the lunch, the Task Force quickly pivoted operational fronts to the trade between the Keburipemi Syndicate and group of Eichornchen whose motives have yet to be identified in the town of Duquin. What followed was a hard day\u0026rsquo;s ride to get out to the Vamberg Peninsula, arriving on the night of the 31st. The first step was to talk to the town Sheriff, who basically just asked the Task Force to take care of the problem. Oisin then talked down the boardwalk to the dock and found a curious man named Mario in a sandwich shack. Mario, it turned out, was not the owner of the sandwich shack, that was his brother Micheal, but he did have some eccentric beliefs which caused Oisin to call for the rest of the Task Force. Among these beliefs were the following:\nKerkard flies via the souls of children harvested when it passes overhead. The Andorr to seize control of a powerful artifact that the elves were going to use destroy the basin. Arendelle is controlled by a shadow government which hates humans and is seeking to push all of the humans out of the country. The Koncord staged the explosion last month to hide the fact that they removed the Sword of Divinity to build a gigantic battle-mech which, when completed will be used to subjugate the whole basin. Roksduens is controlled by a group of furries intent on having orgies all the time. Mario mentioned that a group of Eichen where in town to inspect something and that his brother Micheal was complaining about them. When you asked to see Micheal, Mario ducked under the counter of the sandwich shack and re-appeared with glasses and no hat, introducing himself as Micheal. Micheal than said that the Eichen were hear, he believed, to inspect some of the ships which the Medical Guild had bought from them. They were poor sandwich consumers, though, wanting Eichen specialty ingredients including something with horses. Micheal suggested horse meat but Zorro though horseradish. A night time investigation of the Reculse, the largest seaweed harvesting ship in the fleet, revealed no hidden explosives, but that one of the dingies on the ship had the same name as the one which Niwa reported was going to be used in original exchange in Taerwyn.\nThe next morning, the Task Force talked to Douglas Norris, the foreman at one of the seaweed warehouses who confirmed the Eichen inspection team and said they came every few years as some weird customer service thing that he didn\u0026rsquo;t understand. Interestingly, this year they ordered a dingy into the shops for repairs and replaced it with one that they had brought with them. Doug seemed to think that they were trying to up-sell him on new dingies, and wasn\u0026rsquo;t impressed. Talking to Beca in the boat repair shop supported what the foreman said. Later, when talking to some boat workers, you learned about a group of migrate workers from the Niven Imperium looking for work. After tracking down there wagon, Redfern gulped down a bottle of Dwarven Fire Ale and tried to attack their horse, which I think was a plan to get close to them. Oisin tried to lift the tarp in the wagon, but one of the workers quickly spotted it and lashed the tarp down but not before the shape of a barrel was clearly visible. The task force decided that they had enough information on the parties involved and staked out the Niven group from their windows in the Slithering Seaweed. At was quiet until about 11:30p when the Niven wagon rolled out and Anon told Oisin that the Eichens climbed aboard the Recluse.\n","date":"25 September 2022","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2022-09-25/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin:","title":"Great Basin Session (2022-09-25)"},{"content":"On 28 Fireharvest 1763, a packet of paperwork including this letter came into procession of the Task force.\nGreetings, members of the Task Force.\nAs promised, I will uphold my part of our bargain as you did foil Vicious\u0026rsquo;s evacuation of Taerwyn.\nCylex was created by a military scientist serving under Daimyo Riku at a laboratory in Machi named Ichijou Torime, who is working diligently to increase our manufacturing capacity after being abducted.\nThe Cylex which exploded that night had already been sold. I do not know what the plans for the Cylex was after the point of sale; professional courtesy is important in this line of work after all.\nThe contact for the sale was an Eichhörnchen named Hans. The handoff was supposed to take place at the warehouse in Taerwyn which is currently a pile of rubble, on Fireharvest 23rd. Hans was to arrive in a small boat with three other Eichhörnchen.\nObviously since the Cylex exploded during the raid by the Taerwyn enforcers, it was not possible to complete the deal as contracted. Being difficult to manufacture, the stockpile in Taerwyn was the only large amount of Cylex in existence.\nManufacturing capabilities have continued to grow and a new barrel of Cylex is expected to be ready soon. The trade-off with Hans will occur on Fireharvest 32nd in a town called Duquin in the Kingdom of Trobreryn.\nAs for the Syndicate\u0026rsquo;s production of Cylex, that is not something that I have control over. However, with your help those winds could change. Did you know that the Niven Lantern Festival is coming up next month? It is a major festival to celebrate the work that went into the summer harvest and marks the start of fall. The celebration at the Niven Imperial Palace is very exclusive and also one of the few times where outsiders are not under constant surveillance. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in going, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to use some of your connections to get onto the official invite list.\nRemember that this is a silk kimono event. If you need a tailor, I recommend visiting The Midnight Lotus in Daitoshi. Ask for Takayama.\nWithin this packet is also several invoices written in Niven and Eichen between the two parties as they negotiated for the sale of the Cylex. Notable things include:\nThe Keburipemi Syndicate reached out to Hans about selling the explosive. The final negotiated price was 100,000 gp for one barrel (about 50 gallons). Another Eichhörnchen is named in the negotiations: Marius Kleinheisterkamp Voracious was the agent negotiating on behalf of the Syndicate. The name of the boat for the original rendezvous was \u0026ldquo;suchende Welle\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Seeking Wave\u0026rdquo;.

After receiving payment for the raid on the Kerkrad after it seemed clear that your contact within the Syndicate was not going to delivery any more information.\nLater on, while Redfern was in his room, a massive about of venomous snakes slithered up from under his bed. Distressed, Redfern tried to control the snakes with some evolutionary abilities for Blue Eyes, but ultimately failed to lure then out the window. Finding himself short on allies, with Zorro, Breagan and Wil all away from the islands, Redfern was forced to turn to somebody he has a strained relationship with: Oisin. Oisin was able to help, but not immediately, as he had to transcribe fireball into his spellbook. Several fireballs later, the 300 snakes were mere corpses in the bathtub.\nAfter the rest of the task force returned, they endeavored to learn more about what caused the snake infestation, but to little avail. Tracking the tunnel under Redfern\u0026rsquo;s bed, which looked man-made, only lead to a brief trip to the sewers before Zorro remembered that he had recently learned Greater Detect Magic which can traces spells cast longer ago then regular Detect Magic and offer the option to learn the magic fingerprints of the caster. While both Zorro and later Oisin cast this spell, they were only able to learn that the snakes were not conjured, but where controlled by somebody. Either of them managed to learn the fingerprints of this individual.\nOn the 28th of Fireharvest, while walking home, a business man from the Atreides Duchy bumped into Breagan. Apologizing profusely, he then stated that she must have dropped something and handed her an unmarked envelop. Oisin checked for traps and even opened it from afar with mage hand before the task force retreated to their work room to investigate the contents. The envelop contained a letter written by Niwa Sura, the contact in the Syndicate. Within, she explained that Cylex is being manufactured by the Syndicate, overseen by Ichijou Torime, the original creator of the substance under the direction of Daimyo Riku in the city of Machi, whom the Syndicate had abducted. Additionally, the Cylex which exploded in Taerwyn had already been sold to a Eichhornchen named Hans. Since that explosion consumed all of the available Cylex, a new transfer was arranged in the town of Duquin in the Kingdom of Trobreryn for the night of the 32nd. It seems that the Eichhornchen party paid 100,000 gp for one barrel of Cylex, as well as that Voracious was negotiating on behalf of the Syndicate and another Eichhornchen named Marius Kleinheisterkamp is involved. Background checks on Marius show that he was a demolitions expert in the Eichen Kingdom who was honorably discharged after an explosion injured him. After being discharged, he seems to have mostly fallen off the grid. After this information dump, the letter started talking about the upcoming Niven Lantern Festival on the 10th of Shimmerfall. She mentioned that the Task Force would have to find a way to get onto the official invite list and that this is one of the only events where outsiders aren\u0026rsquo;t under constant surveillance in the Niven Imperial Palace.\nZorro asked Marchi Elenek to issue an order to notify him if Marius passed through any Eichen checkpoints. During his conversation, he also expressed interest in the Lantern Festival after remembering that Marchi is good friends with Ikoma Sakome, one of the representatives from the Niven Imperium. She invited Zorro to join her during her next lunch with Ikoma, scheduled for 30th Fireharvest at The Blue Crow.\n","date":"11 September 2022","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2022-09-11/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"I seemed to have not taken any notes on this session, so this is all coming from memory, please correct me if I\u0026rsquo;m wrong about any of this stuff.","title":"Great Basin Session (2022-09-11)"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;\nIt was Fireharvest 22nd and the members of the task force were engaged in a operation with the Taerwyn city guard against the Keburipemi Syndicate after receiving some intelligence from an operative within the Syndicate, Niwa, as assassin looking to humiliate Vicious in front of the upper leadership of the syndicate.

The two groups exchanged a few awkward glances when a figure that you were sure wasn\u0026rsquo;t their before suddenly appeared. The mysterious figure told the other syndicate members something in Niven and they quickly left the room. While talking to the figure, you learned many things. Her name is Niwa and she seems to be an assassin for the syndicate. Within the city of Taerwyn, the leaders of syndicate operations are a pair of former pirates called Vicious and Voracious, who is Vicious\u0026rsquo;s ankle-biter. Niwa is interested in making Vicious look bad in front of the higher ups in the syndicate and wanted the help of the task force in this endeavor since the local Trobreryn investigative force is not moving fast enough for her. In exchange, she offers information and reveals several things to prove her intent. Namely, the green explosive used in the bombing of the Forum is called cylex and was created in a military research lab in the Niven Imperium before the Keburipemi Syndicate kidnapped the lead researchers and hijacked a load of the explosive.\nVicious plans to evacuate all of the personal and equipment from the city until the investigation blows over, taking a small boat down Drainage Channel E.

Quitely, the keelboat rows into view, manned by eight rowers, captained by Vicious and Voracious.

Talking to Nessa Preston, captain of the Trobreryn guard, she told you that the guard was investigating the Keburipemi Syndicate and the tip had been given by an undercover guard named Arwyn Treharne, who is now missing. She seemed concerned that the task force\u0026rsquo;s plan involved them buying drugs, but did let them leave.\nSpeaking of the task force\u0026rsquo;s plan to track down the people who filled the warehouse with drugs, Oisin was convinced that in order for the humans of the party to play the role of a drug addict in need of another fix, they would need to become addicted to the ever growing collection of drugs that the task force was acquired. Eventually, the rest of the task force talked Oisin down, I think. He visited a magic item stock which had better inventory then most of the shops on Kerkrad, at least the ones that Oisin frequents. Maelor, the proprietor of the Arcane Gateway, seemed very friendly and the connection paid off later when Oisin took Wil there to pay a hat of disguise since he cannot be stopped by certain political enemies of his father Faolan Ragnory. Sadly the Grey Gambler\u0026rsquo;s Hat was just too expensive.\nWaiting until it is dark, Wil took you to an underground fight ring called the Hidden Fist. Everybody paid the 1 gp entry fee except Oisin and Jusa Lok. Wil lead them to a man named Dewey Parcell who would have the goods. He sold Redfern a bottle of Dwarven Fire Ale for 50 gp which he did not drink. Oisin\u0026rsquo;s moth traced him to what seemed to be an abandoned building directly behind the burned husk of the warehouse. Entering through the melted second story windows, and continuing one of my personally favorite things to do in these game; finding alternative ways in to structures, the task force found an deserted second floor with beat up furniture and debris around. Moving down stairs, you quickly realized that there was a lot of unaccounted for space since the staircase dead ended at the door leading to outside. Oisin found a sliding panel which revealed an unfinished first story with a loose gravel or dirt floor. Walking around to the other side of the room, you found some stairs leading down.\nFollowing them, you traced them to a small room with two chairs at a low table and their was an offshoot leading to what you believe is the warehouse, however that end of the tunnel has collapsed. Continuing inward, you found a small store room where Zorro opened one of the creates to find a bong. After investigating a small closet, your attention was turned to another door which you could occasionally hear guards on the other side of. Moving quickly, you headed down a corridor to your left and into a cramped bathroom, well a cramped pit toilet. Hi-jinx ensued when a pair of guards which Wil needed to see to use his hat of disguise to imitative spotted him through the cracked door. Oisin used mage hand to sling some shit around and pretend to be very ill and the guards left. Wil disguised himself as one of the guards and did a lap of the base. He reported that there was a main room which seemed to be a barrack, three other unexplored door and a pair of double doors craved with a Niven character.\nSneaking in the other direction, the task force entered the armory which had two people in it cleaning weapons. The two groups exchanged awkward glances when unexpectedly another figure appeared in between the two. They spoke in a low tone speaking Niven to the other two, who quickly left through a hidden exit in the bad of one of the lockers.\n","date":"10 April 2022","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2022-04-10/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin, the data was 20 Fireharvest 1763.","title":"Great Basin Session (2022-04-10)"},{"content":"Went we last ventured to the Great Basin, the date was 6 Fireharvest 1763.\nThe week was moving slowly, with few events of note. On the 7th, the task force was delivered a message from Vessimur Yutros, a delegate from the Principality of Vi. He told you that all the members of the task force were expected to appear before the assembled Forum in two days time on the 9th. When the task force entered the forum chambers, the delegates were loudly arguing over the protests at the docks two times before and weather the docks should be opened again. Bur Harcosa called the forum to order with a supernaturally loud bang from his gavel and asked the task force to make a report. Oisin stepped up to the plate, and told them that the green substance is the explosive used during the bombing and that it reacts to electricity but is otherwise stable. He also stated that there was no lead on the left glove of bony power and did not mention anything about the coin. The Forum seemed a bit disappointed about the apparent lack of progress, non more-so then Janus Brutus from the Empire of Xylte, who made some \u0026ldquo;I told you so\u0026rdquo; comments about the task force being able to look into this matter. The Forum told you to keep investigating.\nThey did want to here your opinion about weather or not to open the docks, since the main reason for keeping them closed was to aid the investigation. During an internal discussion, you all quickly agreed that the docks should be opened, but were not able to agree on what level of activity or regulation should be required. The side championed by Breagan wanted active searches of every vessel coming or going from the city whereas the opposition lead by Redfern advocated a complete reopening. Ultimately, you decided to make a formal recommendation to open the docks but left the details to the Forum delegates. They eventually decided to open the docks completely since that would mean that they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to provide other aid to the dock workers. In a heated moment, Barno Henchor threw a knife at Leopold Kadlec, who surprisingly caught the knife midair and launched it back at Barno.\nEaton and the other head of the Bastion of the Sky, a quiet man in shiny silver full plate armor, then have a report about the investigation following the protests at the docks. Eaton reported that 82 individuals were arrested and they are actively cross-referencing and compiling statements from all of them, but an estimated 150 additional people were at the riot. The organizing group was determined to be a new group calling itself the Kerkard Union of Dock Workers, lead by one Tycho Magnentius from the Empire of Xylte. It seems that they were demanding the immediate opening of the docks and several other, but sometimes conflicting demands about the working conditions in the docks.\nThat night, Breagan\u0026rsquo;s father paid her a visit to tell her that a family friend, Aleksandra Corrmwell, the Decider of Siedem in the Kingdom of Galimatias was killed while hunting bison on the 8 Fireharvest. The funeral service was on the 15th.\nThe week of the 12th was otherwise devoid of leads and the task force had little work to do, but late into the night on the 19th of Fireharvest, both Wil and Redfern were awoken with a start. Blue Eyes reported hearing something akin to thunder, and they all decided to take a walk, meeting up outside and travelling west to the edge of the city. Looking down, you saw a bright flame, tinged with green below. While it was difficult to localize the origin of the fire, it was determined using the current location of Kerkrad and the fact that the fire was on the shore of Kratermeer that it was on the outskirts of Taerwyn, the capital of Trobreryn.\nRushing to wake up the rest of the task force and the delegates from Trobreryn, Videla Parre and Peric Abell, the task force used the teleportation network to go to Taerwyn. Navigating the city, Wil lead them to a small warehouse which had evidently exploded to assist the fire brigades trying to contain the white-hot blaze. When most of the group came under the affects of a hallucinogen from the fumes, the four sober members, Oisin, Breagan, Wil and Blue Eyes deduced that this was a drug warehouse and started pulling people from the fire, all of them members of the Trobreryn guard. Shortly thereafter, Nessa Preston the captain of the Trobreryn guard arrived on scene with several cyromages as Breagan was searching the debris for the explosive used in the Bombing of the Forum. With a natural 20 on a perception check, she found in the blasted remains of a metal barrel two vials of the substance in question. Nessa explained to the task force that her forces were conducting a drug raid with 24 soldiers. in the Bombing of the Forum.

Initially their was some doubts on the behalf of Oisin on weather the task force should even be involved with this operation, but Eaton seemed to want you there. Alisha and the staff are not happy to be raiding, at least that is how they view it. Searching the store, and in particular the safe which Germaine Shamra opens for the group, you find a total of eight vials, only two of which are identified as scorpion venom and a drug called Serpent\u0026rsquo;s Kiss, which is a favorite among the politicians since it increases confidence. The search also revealed a few other substances like soul stimulant and Ambrosia which are drugs that are generally only available in professional healing wards staffed by clerics. While talking to Kjell Blogmer, you learn something very interesting to Redfern: Kjell is originally from Roksduens and his parents somehow left when he was a baby after his older brother was killed during a raid. However, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how they left. The other staff at the shop was Roxanne Lloyd, a 19 year old tattoo artist who learned the trade from Alisha starting at the young age of 14 apparently. She was the most combative with the questioning. The full time apothecary who is considering moving to the new term of pharmacist is Germaine Shamra, a vishkayna with green eyes.\nZorro and Blue Eyes, who had been waiting outside during the bulk of the operation where instructed by Oisin to try to search the apartment above the store which is not included in the warrant. Zorro climbed the wall to find a locked window looking into a small bathroom. Unable to open the window, he was assisted by Oisin\u0026rsquo;s familiar casting knock. Looking around, the invisible Zorro was not able to find anything unusual in the apartment (but also didn\u0026rsquo;t check \u0026ldquo;the places people hide drugs\u0026rdquo;), before he was heard downstairs by Eaton, several other members of the task force and it would seem Alisha who made several comments about Eaton\u0026rsquo;s people not being allowed in the apartment. Eaton bashed open the door with his scizore after Alisha refused to open the door, but fortunately Zorro had made his escape by then. Eaton did a precursory glance and didn\u0026rsquo;t see anybody in the apartment, so he left quickly.\nDuring the final round of questioning, Eaton told you that something was happening about five blocks clockwise that he was needed at and the task force decided to accompany him to see what was happening.\nEaton and the rest of the task force show up just before the pinnacle of the protest. Oisin casts fly on himself and goes to get ramen. Rokkaku and the staff are very nervous about this, so or Oisin thinks (in reality they were ready for a fight) when the rocks start flying and the Bastion of the Sky sweeps in to arrest as many people as possible. Their forces are directed by somebody that the task force as not meant before wearing very shiny full plate armor. Wil helps defend the ramen shop, so Rokkaku tells him that he can eat for free from on now.\n","date":"27 March 2022","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2022-03-27/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;","title":"Great Basin Session (2022-03-27)"},{"content":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin,\nThe illustrious members of the task force were engaged in a battle with odd creatures with hunched backs, backwards hooved feet, elongated snouts and protruding tusks in the storage room of the Temple of Kroina in Kerkrad. After a feisty battle which saw several sun beetles\u0026rsquo; glowing guts getting scattered over the room, the creatures were defeated and upon death, they transformed into the corpses of regular boars.\nTalking with Pastor Kendall of the Temple, you learned that this temple has been buying Trance Wine from Alisha for four years since she is able to get great deals for it and that occasionally she brings another to help with the work, but it\u0026rsquo;s not always one person like Diana. On the way back from the temple, the party filled Jusa Lok in the details of the investigation, that the blood on the coin found at the site of the 1763-03-34 Bombing of the Forum belonged to the last king of Andorr, Ydin.\nConvinced that Alisha may be connected to their investigation, or at the very least a shady character, Oisin goes to talk to Eaton about the steps needed to search her Herbal Remedies and Tattoo shop. Eaton said that you had the authority to talk her, but a full search would require a warrant signed by any member of the Forum. The task force then splits, with a group consisting of Luna, Oisin, and Zorro visiting Rokkaku_s Ramen for some good noodles. While there, Oisin, who is the only regular customer from the group asks Rokkaku why the place feels dead. \u0026ldquo;6p on an Izudaq? The place should be hoppin.\u0026rdquo; Rokkaku told him that since the docks are still closed after the bombing of the forum, the docker workers aren\u0026rsquo;t getting paid and can\u0026rsquo;t affort to eat out. He also expressed concern about being able to source indgredents from the Niven Imperium if the docks stay closed for too much longer.\nMeanwhile, a different group consisting of Breagan, Redfern, Blue Eyes, Wil and Jusa Lok were dining in the Kingdom of Galimatias with Breagan\u0026rsquo;s parents on typical polish fare. Jacob Nowak, her father is a member of the forum and her mother Ola is the event coordinator of the royal castle of the Kingdom. Over dinner you talked to Jacob about signing a warrant to search Alisha\u0026rsquo;s Herbal Remedies and Tattoo Parlor and he expressed some concern about this being outside the scope of the task force since their was no concrete evidence connecting her to the thief of the sword. Eventually, he agreed to sign the warrant on the condition that Eaton accompany the task force. There was also a conversation between Breagan and Jacob right as the task force was leaving where he expressed concern over Breagan\u0026rsquo;s well being and mentioned that the Krig Marchi Elenek wanted to jail the members of the task force if they didn\u0026rsquo;t agree join.\nLater then evening, Oisin\u0026rsquo;s familiar returned from scouting Alisha\u0026rsquo;s shop. They reported that they did not see Alisha or Diana there, but gave a description of three others working in the shop. - A human with a green pixie hair cut and lots of tattoos. She also went out back into an alley for a smoke break, and the back door seemed to be unlocked before and after she was in the ally. - A dwarf who must be very young, since he only has a few inches of beard. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s really the only way I know to estimate the age of a dwarf\u0026rdquo;. - Another vishkayna, this one with green eyes rather they the golden ones that Alisha has.\n","date":"20 March 2022","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2022-03-20/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"When we last ventured to the Great Basin,","title":"Great Basin Session (2022-03-20)"},{"content":"During our last venture to the Great Basin\u0026hellip;\nThe task force entered the Temple of Kroina and quickly noticed that everybody was sleep. They found some moderate strength magical auras in the temple and were just starting to question Diana when Alisha emerged from one of the storage rooms. She explains that Diana is blind and hopes that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t causing any problems. The task force is very suspicions about the two women and Alisha explains that she runs an apothecary called \u0026ldquo;Alisha\u0026rsquo;s Herbal Remedies and Tattoo Parlor\u0026rdquo; and that she is hear to restock something called Trance Wine which is used by worshipers of Kroina to place themselves in a deep meditative state.\nJust when the party is relaxing a bit, a loud scraping noise of stone on stone is heard from the room Alisha was in. Wil goes to check it out and sees three figures, with heavily hunched backs and elongated snouts with pronounced tusks. They had primitive, claw like hands and backward legs and hooves, but they are not immediately hostile. Calling out to the other members of the task force, Wil relayed what he saw and suspicions about Alisha were immediately raised once more. Oisin presses Alisha for an explanation and find that she is not able to get a satisfactory answer and is also not telling the whole truth. Alisha tries to take Diana and leave the temple but is blocked by Blue Eyes and an unseen servant summoned by Oisin.\nUpon Wil stepping in to the storage room, one of the bestial humanoids destroys a shelf by ripping the leg off of it and banishing it like a club towards WIl. Wil, Redfern, Dr. Luna and Zorro move to engage these creatures, while Breagan, Oisin and Blue Eyes continue to prevent Alisha and Diana from leaving, which them seem eager to do. Breagan is able to detect that Alisha is evil and moves to engage her, landing some solid blows on Alisha. Alisha appears to be a competent combatant who is able to evade several blows before striking Blue Eyes with a poisoned dagger.

Frustrated by her lack of progress, Dr. Luna conducted increasingly risky experiments until she passed a large amount of electricity through the material, were it promptly exploded destroying the entire lab, blowing a hole in the exterior of the library and nearly kills her. Swiftly arriving on site is Eaton, the investigative head of the Bastion of the Sky. He is furious to find on of the task force members at the heart of the incident, but admits to not having the authority to arrest her as much as he wants to. He does inform Dr. Luna that he will be filing a report to the Forum about the incident and is somewhat happy that the blast wasn\u0026rsquo;t for nothing and Dr. Luna learned how to detonate the mystery substance.\nThat night around the docks, which are still under a lock down after the blast during the Founder\u0026rsquo;s Gala, Oisin is almost caught by a patrol of bastion members, but they narrowly miss him.\nThe next day, 3 Fireharvest 1763, the task force is visited by Marchi Elenek, the Krig and the forum delegate who is the most involved with the task force. She is also unhappy about the explosion in the library, and finds that the task force members, namely Oisin and Breagan I believe, were not very trusting of her. She tells everybody that trust has to go both directions. She trusted you by not having you all thrown in the holding cells and wants you to trust her back.\nAfter the Krig leaves, Breagan goes in search of physically red tape and returns with a roll of green, orange and pink tape. When Zorro goes to pick up his requested records (delegates) from the now damaged library, he gets into a discussion about the history of Ændor with Oisin. Zorro was taught that Andorr was a minor power represented by the Empire of Xylte, but when they tried to leave the Koncord of Kieros, the Empire invaded them. Eichen troops were also part of the conflict and were recorded stopping forces from the Empire from committing flagrant atrocities.\nOisin goes to check up on Eaton, and tries to repair the degrading relationship between him and the task force. They are able to come to an agreement that they are both trying to protect the Koncord and prevent more people from being hurt. He also promises to send a list of everybody who was at the Founder\u0026rsquo;s Gala.\nMeanwhile, Redfern and Zorro visit Silvius Albina, one of the delegates from the Empire of Xylte. They find him to be very old and senile, telling them that it was probably the Andorrans who tried to assassinate their emperor last week who were behind the attack on the Forum. Frustrated with Silvius, they enter unannounced to the office of Janus Brutus, the other delegate from the Empire. She is much more composed than Silvius, basically telling them that they are just waiting for him to die. She explains that the Empire didn\u0026rsquo;t assign anybody to the task force since they don\u0026rsquo;t really care and do not think that a group from as many different cultures as the task force could possibly solve the mystery anyways.\nThe task force realize that Jusa has not been seen all day and both the attendant in the Tower of the Principality of Vi and Vessimur suggest the church as likely places for a cleric to be.

During a trip to the library to get the materials needed for a conspiracy board, Oisin and Will encountered Julius Peperthorn, Oisin\u0026rsquo;s Antiquarian. He seemed to think that Oisin was lucky for not getting expelled from the library and did drop some information about the missing Sword of Divinity, which apparently has connections to holy fire and that several people have tried to steal it in the past but where disintegrated in a burst of holy flames.\nBase at home base, the task force started to piece together what they knew and what questions they needed answered. They discussed - A possible connection between the Glove of Bony Power and the ability to pull the sword from the rock. - The use of the explosion as an entry or exit point - People that needed to be investigated, including - The formal attendees from the Founder\u0026rsquo;s Gala. - The on-duty security guards. - The catering and service people, such as the crew from the Blue Crow.\nThe next day, 2 Fireharvest 1763, Breagan wakes early to try and find anything that the original investigative party missed at the scene of the crime. Arriving just before the construction crew started work, Breagan was not able to find any undiscovered tracks or clues. Meanwhile, Oisin used the spell Alter Self to assume the form of whomever left blood on the Gold Coin of the Crown that was found at the explosion site. The change was subtle, he grew a bit taller and older with longer hair but generally did not change in any measurable way. Oisin recognized this form is Ydin, the King of Ændor when it came under the control of the Empire of Xylte. He told the party that Ydin was killed on the floor of the Forum chamber on 10 Darknight 1623. Soon after, Dr. Luna left for the library to investigate the green paste. She talked with a 2 key curator named Bazyli Marchewka who seemed knowledgeable about explosives but a bit scatterbrained as she would frequently leave Dr. Luna to go fetch something from elsewhere in the library. During the day Zorro stopped by the library and requested that they prepare records from the last 200 years of Forum Delegates for his review which they stated would be ready the next day, (3 Fireharvest 1763). The rest of the party split into teams of two to inquire into the governments which did not assign members to the task force. - Redfern and Will schedule an appointment with Silvius Albina of the Empire of Xylte for the next day at 3:30p for 30 minutes. - Breagan and Oisin talk to Ikoma from the Niven Imperium and she tells them that the Imperium is launching its own investigation since it has people with \u0026ldquo;specific talents\u0026rdquo; that are not represented in the current task force and that they believe that the investigation will proceed smoother without the red tape associated with the Forum. - Will and Zorro talked with Lord Cantort of the Atreides Duchy who tells them that the Atreides have a strong reputation of neutrality and that he suspects that whatever the task force find will be very controversial and require delicate handling so in order to better position the Duchy politically they cannot be involved in how those reports are generated. - Oisin and Breagan attempted to visit the delegates from the Principality of Vi but found themselves in the tower of the Commune of Atrxous instead. They briefly talked to the delegate there and Leopold, a Tangus, offered them some sandwiches he had made earlier and encouraged them to stop by anytime. - Correctly locating the tower of the Principality, Oisin and Breagan where then able to score a conference with both of the delegates, Bur Harcosa and Vessimur Yutros. The delegates seemed perhaps like there were in some form of disagreement and were not overly concerned with the members of the task force, but they did introduce the assigned member to the task force from the Principality, Jusa Lok.\nJusa is a human woman and member of the Church of Kroina, Lady Foresight. During the meeting she seemed nervous and stressed, leading to an awkward exchange with Oisin about killing each other.

At the gala would be all ten of the Forum delegates, most of the heads of state from the member nations of the Koncord and lots of other nobles and business people from all over the Great Basin.\nAs fate would have it, the future members of the task force were all seated together since members from different cultures are expressly encouraged to mingle within the diverse group of attendees. Entertainment was provided in the form of a short play from Wilfred Montmore depicting brothers lost in a magical jungle encountering all sorts of oddities that had an unusual romantic element to it with both protagonists choosing to stay in the woods with their loves.\nThe Herske of the Forum, Bur Harcosa gave the keynote speech, going on for a long time about the benefits of the Koncord when its members are in jeopardy, recounting the tale of the Immolation Crisis from his own nation the Principality of Vi. (Oisin was enthusiastic to know the solidarity of the Koncord towards its members).\nAfter the speech, the climax of the entertainment was to be had, a fireworks show with interpretive dance from the Kerkard Dance Troop. However, during a small gap in the fireworks, a large explosion was hear and seen with debris blasted over the top of the Forum building. The guards immediately reacted to protect the attendees of the Gala which did include locking them into the courtyard. The Krig Marchi Elenek took a team of guards from the Bastion of the Sky into the Forum building to investigate. Seeking to gain information, Redfern sent Blue Eyes skyward to see the damage to the building and saw a large hole in the back of the building though which Marchi could be seen with a person who was later revealed to be Eaton, the head of the investigative department of the Bastion of the Sky.\nDetermined to help, particularly after learning that Dr. Luna was a bomb expert, Oisin tried to lead the party into the Form Building. Meet with four guards and a guard captain, Oisin cast suggestion on the captain to get everybody into the building.\nUpon entry, it was quickly pieced together that the explosion occurred in the chamber were the delegates meet to conduct their business. Walking in at sword point, our adventurers were confronted by Marchi and a very short human wearing black clothing and a red cloak named Eaton who introduced himself as the investigative head of the Bastion of the Sky. He was unimpressed with Dr. Luna\u0026rsquo;s deductive skills and insisted that he did not need help in the investigation. Marchi agreed and escorted the group out to make a preliminary statement and dismiss the gala attendees with the exception of the party.\nInstead she held you all their for an hour before giving you summons to appear before the Forum the next day.

Since you knew that the Sword of Divinity was stolen, you were assigned to the task force to investigate the thief and recover the sword. The thing is, officially you are only to investigate and punish those behind the bombing since the lost of the sword is very much classified. Each member state was given the chance to assign somebody to the task force, with all of your governments picking you. This is how the other governments reacted: - Empire of Xylte: Disavowed the investigation entirely, stating that they didn\u0026rsquo;t believe that a multinational task force could possibly conduct a fair and just investigation. - Niven Imperium: Stated that they will cooperate with the investigation, would not be assigning a member and will be launching their own investigation. - Commune of Atrxous: Tried to assign a member, Hynek Linhart, a shoemaker from Plumlov and was overruled following a grievance from Barno of the Eichen Kingdom. - Atreides Duchy: In order to maintain neutrality they also declined to assign a representative. - Principality of Vi: Was interested in assigning a member, but did not have a representative on hand.\n","date":"23 January 2022","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2022-01-23/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"The Founder\u0026rsquo;s Gala of 1763 was two nights away.","title":"Great Basin Session (2022-01-23)"},{"content":"There are four NPC kingdoms in the Great Basin. Below you will find a brief description of each, a few notable people in each and some common names among the commoners.\nAtreides Duchy # The Atreides Duchy is located in the northwest of the Great Basin, directly above the Principality of Vi. The government of the Duchy is centered around the Duke and Duchess, currently Leto and Jessica Atreides. There capital city of Caladan is not opulent like some other capital cities, but it is very welcoming. That describes the Atreides people well, not the wealthiest, but very generous and sharing with others. They are one of the first to offer assistance to other kingdoms and because of this are generally well liked by the other members of the Koncord.\nGovernment Structure # The title of Duke is hereditary, pasted from parents to the eldest child through the generations. The Duke and Duchess serve as the executive seat of power, directing the military and negotiating with the other kingdoms. Laws are enforced by the Duke and Duchess but passed by the Landsraad, a legislature consisting of representatives from towns and cities of the Duchy with a set number of representatives per population bracket. Individual cities are able to pick representative however they feel.\nLocations # Capital City: Caladan Secondary Cities: Acadia Bellfort People # Four Important Figures: Duke Leto Atreides Duchess Jessica Atreides Master at Arms Gurney Halleck Leader of the military forces of the Duchy. While these forces are small, Halleck is an well known and respected warrior and likewise the quality of the Atreides infantry is very high. Mentat Thufir Hawat The Mentat title is a very important one within the Atreides Duchy, reversed for a trusted advisor with a truly formidable breadth of knowledge. Hawat uses a spacial meditative state to strength his mental abilities. Four Common Names: Molly Thomas Robert Katherine Naming Guidelines: British English Commune of Atrxous # Most of the other governments have centralized power structure, but not the Commune of Atrxous. This government is communism, enforced via a magic contract called The Atrxous. Once you sign the contract, you agree to share all of your wealth, shed your social status and live for the betterment of the Commune. Violating the contract is impossible, enforced via enchantment magic and the transmutation of the valuable to the worthless.\nGovernment Structure # Formally speaking, there is no structure to the government since there is effectively no government. Generally there is no need for one either since the Atrxous prevents crimes from being committed against others who have signed it.\nLocations # Capital City: (If they formally had one) Atrxous\nHardly more than a hamlet, Atrxous holds the contract in the only fully stone building in the Commune\nPeople # Important NPCs: Forum Delegate Brigita Červinkov Forum Delegate Leopold Kadlec 4 Common Names: Ludvik Kristian Saskie Dagmar Language of Inspiration: Longer names, often with harsh consonant sounds. Similar to Czech. Niven Imperium # The Niven Imperium is undoubted a force to be reckoned with, if they ever wanted to. This government is relatively isolationist and stagnant. That last major reform was implemented over 200 years ago. While the three major cities are decadent and bustling, the status of the villages and farmers is relatively unknown. The Imperium is also known to be the only government with several settlements on the outer flanks of the boundary ridge of the Basin.\nGovernment Structure # The Imperium is ruled by an Emperor, who has absolute power but rarely uses it. Most of the daily administration of the Imperium is facilitated between military leader, the Shogun and the primary advisor to the Emperor, who uses the title of Adobaizā.\nPlaces # Capital City: Daitoshi\nAn absolutely massive city rife with vice and violence under the less than watchful personal guard of the Emperor.\nSecondary Cities: Machi Smaller and located deep in the mountains, Machi started as a research station working with rare mountain ores but has since grown into a large alpine city. It is still home to the Machi Laboratories, a renowned research facility that seems to be in decline, overtaken by newer facilities in other kingdoms. Mura Smaller than even Machi, Mura is the agricultural hub of the empire, where farmers come from the fertile plains below the mountains to sell goods up the main trade route to Daitoshi and Machi. People # Four Important NPCs: Shogun Ichika, the Dragon Slayer Ichika is a brilliant strategist, and one of the most respected generals in the Great Basin, famous for her single handed take down of a black dragon hunting travelers in a mountain pass now know as the Tail of the Dragon that left her without a left arm or left eye. Emperor Yuusei Whatever Yuusei wants he shall receive, and as a result he wants for nothing. He few obligations include being the formal head of state of the Imperium, so he travels to other governments when needed. Diamyo Riku A Diamyo is a regional warlord and Riku is the warlord of Machi.

I can see that you have spent a long day in traveling. Pull up a seat next to the fire; it will warm your body while the mead warms your soul.\nThis region is called the Great Basin, and everything from the name to the politics stems back from an event called Land-Shatter or the Shattering. It happened about 1750 years ago and formed that ring of mountains surrounding the Great Basin.\nThe only reason there is still any life here is thanks to Kieros and her Five Heralds of Virtue to save us from destruction. You see, this massive rock from the heavens impacted, creating the basin. It was only through the heroics of Kieros and her Heralds that the everyone was able to unite in time to save the realm from extinction, or so the story goes.\nWhile she lost her life to save all of us, the most prevalent use of her name know a days is the Koncord of Kieros. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how it was founded, but the Ten Kingdoms now control it. Depending on who you ask, the Koncord is either a formal place of negotiation and grievance or a tool to ensure the stability of the top of the socioeconomic ladder. It is an archaic body with both no formal power but absolute power over its members. I\u0026rsquo;d heard that they forced kingdoms to violate their most sacred traditions to please the greater body of the Forum, simply over the fear of disobeying.\nThe Forum, or ruling council of the Koncord, is composed of the 10 largest powers in the Basin and each one gets two representatives. All smaller powers like city states or wizard enclaves are considered to be within the borders of one of the 10 Kingdoms from the eyes of the Koncord, even if they receive no benefits or support from the power representing them.\nThe Forum operates on a system of resolutions and grievances. Resolutions are non-enforceable decrees that all members should follow, while grievances are allegations of wrong doing filed be a plaintiff against a respondent. Resolutions can to anything from mandate the market price of goods or add and remove members from the council. Grievances have been used to stop executions of high value political prisoners, expose spies or do things as petty as force a kingdom to take down unflattering artwork of another kingdom\u0026rsquo;s ruler.\nIf no resolutions or grievances have been filled about a topic, then the Koncord has no official stance on it and anything goes. The few times it has become an issue, the Forum\u0026rsquo;s parliamentarian has ruled that resolutions are binding across multiple instances of an issue but grievances are never binding outside of their original context, however they can be argued as precedent in future rulings on any issue.\nI personally doubt that Kieros would approve of the Koncord, but after her death it has continued to evolve into its current form. Their is no real guiding document, only her journals which focus more on crises response and optimistic visions for a unified future free of oppression after the Shattering.\nThe Forum represents both the legislative and executive power of the Koncord, with resolutions serving as \u0026rsquo;laws\u0026rsquo; and various titles distributed between the delegates. Those titles are\nHerske (Prime Minister): The formal head of state. Ties in the Forum are broken by whichever side the Prime Minister voted for. Krig (Commander in Chief): Serves as the military leader and primary coordinator between of the join military operations the Koncord conducts. Regler (Parliamentarian): Maintains the rules and protocols of the Forum. Viden (Scientific \u0026amp; Arcane Liaison): Advises the Forum on updates of either arcane or scientific natures and is responsible for allocation of research based funds. Penge (Economic Advisor): Advises the overarching economy policies of the Koncord which regulate inter-kingdom trade. The judicial power of the Koncord is run indirectly through the Kerkrad city guard, also called the Bastion of the Sky, as primarily a bounty hunters guild. The Forum votes to place a bounty on somebody\u0026rsquo;s head stating the amount and if they are wanted dead or alive. Anybody can then capture the bounty and turn them in to the Bastion of the Sky to receive the reward. If they are wanted alive, any living condition is accepted but if brought in dead, no reward will be given except under spacial circumstances. Generally speaking, most of the people both are brought in alive are questioned and then executes either by blade or sometimes by being dropped off the side of Kerkrad. In the last few years, the Forum has realized that this system can be easily adapted to monster hunting as well, however they see to favor dead rewards for some reason I cannot fathom\u0026hellip;\nThe Koncord is headquartered in Kerkrad, the City Above. The basis of that city is actually the core of Xylte, the rock from the heavens which caused the Shattering. The magics behind how that thing achieved flight is well beyond a barkeep like me even though I live here now, but somehow it did. I do remember hearing that they wanted to base the Koncord off that rock so that the Central Forum would be equally accessible, or perhaps equally inaccessible to all. There are certainly a lot of nobles who have moved to the city.\nDecisions from the Forum are relied to the populous of the Basin using a network of Bard, like that jackass over there Hi Steven, who are frequently seen talking to crows.\nBut what do I know, for I\u0026rsquo;m a humble barkeep here.\nNow, would you like anything to drink?\n\u0026ndash; Matthew Schween, Barkeeper, The Blue Crow, Kerkrad.\nOther Information # Calendar # The modern calendar which is officially used by the Koncord for all business matters, currently has the year as 1763, and has 9 months per year:\nSproutmoor (35 days) Verdantwave (35 days) Goldwave (34 days) Fireharvest (36 days) Shimmerfall (33 days) Whitermire (34 days) Frostgain (33 days) Iceharvest (35 days) Darknight (33 days) Snowdwindle (36 days) Riverrun (34 days) The year starts in early to mid spring, as the crops are being planted around the Great Basin. Each week has six days:\nKierdaq Azeedaq Gradaq Xuldaq Izudaq Rimedaq Lore # The days of the week, like many other things in the Great Basin are named after the heroes who saved the basin from destruction from Xylte before it was a basin. This group of adventures were lead by Kieros and are collectively called The Six Heralds, or sometimes just The Heralds and occasionally Kerios\u0026rsquo;s Heralds and derivations there of.\nKieros: Savior of the Shattering Azeem: Herald of Foresight Gralf: Herald of Courage Izuka: Herald of Knowledge Rimev: Herald of Happiness Xul: Herald of Stealth Creation Guidelines # Everything in this category is optional, but strongly encouraged as a starting point for the creates of your character and kingdom. All pathfinder rules can be found on the Archives of Nethys, which does an excellent job aggregating options like feats, spells and magic ideas from 10 years worth of source books. Your character is level 5, using a 20 point buy for ability scores. You should have 10,500 GP to spend on equipment. Please try to even distribute the money and not buy a super expensive magic sword but have no armor or other items. I reserve the right audit all equipment purchases for character creation.\nCharacter Backstory Guidelines # Just like all of us, your character has a history before meeting the rest of the party. Here are some fairly standard prompts to get you thinking about your character.\nWhere are they from within your kingdom? A rural village or the capital city? Why did they decide to join the government? How do they feel about their government and the Koncord of Kieros? What is there family like? Parents or siblings or children? What is there favorite food and beverage? How old are they? What are some core moral principles that they will try not to violate? What would it take for them to violate these believes? Who is your character\u0026rsquo;s role model? Pet peeve? What is your character\u0026rsquo;s biggest flaw? Who do they trust, or distrust and why? Any secrets? Here is a link that I found with a long list of questions in case you would like to see some more.\nThere will be a few thinks that I expect from your backstory, but of course the more information and better.\nRelationship with family At least one friend or ally that you could go to in an emergency At least one rival or enemy within the government, perhaps somebody you to crossed to get a promotion or don\u0026rsquo;t think your character is fit for their job. UPDATE This is a very important one that I completely forgot about:\nGive your character a strong ambition. What do they want to accomplish? What drives them into the political fray? Why do they think they can help their government? Kingdom Creation Guidelines # A government according to the dictionary is\ngov·ern·ment\n/ˈɡəvər(n)mənt​/\nthe system by which a nation, state or community is governed. the relation between the governed and a governing word. So the most important thing to think about is the relationship between the government and the people. In no particular order, here are some considerations and questions.\nWhat responsibilities does the government owe the people, if any? Where is power concentrated within the government? How do the people welding this power feel about it? Where does the power of the government come from? A mandate from the people? A military backed regime? Something else magical and exotic? While it is important to keep this somewhat grounded in reality, this is a government in a fantasy world with a different sets of resources and problems than any government in the real world. How is power transferred between administrations or regimes? What are the overriding government ethics and principles of this government? What are the ambitions of this government? How do the people feel about the current government? Are they happy with it? Do they think it is stagnant and weak (which can be the public view even if it\u0026rsquo;s incorrect), or maybe suspicion and mistrust? Once you have the general feel of the government, more concrete details are needed. Your character is part of this government. How do they fit in? How do they feel about the government as a whole and the people in power there? What is there specific duties within the government?\nA kingdom is more than just a government. It is a people and a culture too. What are the people of your kingdom like? How diverse is the population, only human or dwarf or squirrel or are there multiple species represented? If the latter, how to they get along, has the government favored one or more of them in the past?\nWhat traditions are upheld in your kingdom? Any festivals or rites of passages? What are your people proud of?\nThese are just some starting points, if you have any other question or wish to discuss anything with me, please reach out.\n","date":"10 November 2021","permalink":"/ttrpg/great-basin/documents/intro-great-basin/","section":"Ttrpgs","summary":"Greetings weary traveler!","title":"Introduction to the Great Basin"},{"content":" Koncord of Kieros # All of the governments are members of Koncord of Kieros. The Koncord serves as a formal discussion forum and supervisory body for all of the local governments. The Koncord was founded by Kieros to protect the entire region from some threat. Good contenders are a war between all of the kingdoms or a massive natural disaster like a meteor impact or a plague, something were the governments needed to set aside their differences and work together.\nThe below statement in italics is false, but left here for historical reasons.\nAfter the founding of the Koncord, Kieros\u0026rsquo;s clan took over the administration of the Koncord. Past Caretakers of the Koncord have been authoritarian and treated the rest of the governments as subjects, but the current Prime Minister is very relaxed and the modern Koncord is very similar to the United Nations, tending to pass non-binding resolutions.\nThe Koncord is based out of the flying city of Kerkrad, which is also mobile and travels the region. It is connected to its consistent capital cities via teleportation circles.\nWhat does the formal grievance process look like? Debate and vote by the council, which gets the final say. Grievances can interrupt internal processes via threat of sanctions. What was the catastrophic event that lend to the creation of the Koncord? Or do you not know?

Standardized rules of engagement? No. Limits on governmental actions? Either totally or in the territory of other nations. Grievance based. How common is magic which enhances spying? Like scrying?

Before moving to Madison, I got my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Michigan Technological University, graduating in December 2022. While at Michigan Tech, I served as a Learning Center Coach for four semesters, Teaching Assistant for two semesters, and a Lab Instructor for one semester. During the summer of 2021, I participated in the Google Summer of Code by working with NetworkX on implementing an Asymmetric Traveling Salesperson Problem algorithm. The next summer, I was part of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program funded through the National Science Foundation. Working with Dr. Satish Puri, I developed an multi-threaded C++ system for finding the approximate nearest neighbor for polygons.\nFor more information, please see my resume.\nResearch Interests # My experiences with the research projects over the last two summers have developed my interest in approximation algorithms. In particular, the REU had me working on a fundamental problem in machine learning and data science: the nearest neighbor problem. I believe that approximation algorithms will play a critical role in the future of computing, as the amount of data available seems to be growing faster than available computing power. Through my work with NetworkX and several graph theory classes at Michigan Tech, graph theory is another passion of mine and I would like to explore how graphs can be used aid in approximate algorithms.\nMoving Forward # Right now, I\u0026rsquo;m looking for connecting with the professors at UW-Madison to find potential advisors. After getting a Ph.D, I\u0026rsquo;d like to stay in academia and become a professor myself. While working at Michigan Tech in a variety of student-facing roles, I developed a passion for teaching and sharing my knowledge with other students. Education has been an important life-long journey for me and I would like to share that with other students.\nOther Interests # Outside of my academia interests, I am passionate about open source software, which I believe is important for a private and secure digital experience. In my free time, I enjoy playing tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons or Pathfinder, and you can actually find information on this site relating to my games.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"Background # I am currently an incoming Ph.","title":"About Me"},{"content":" Ingredients # 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded thin 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons adobo sauce from a small can of Chipotle peppers 1 tablespoon chili powder 1 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon oregano or Italian seasoning 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper Directions # Combine chicken garlic, olive oil, adobo sauce and seasoning in a large bowl (or ziplock bag), cover with plastic wrap.

To marinate the chicken, make sure the chicken is washed and dried a few minutes before. Take out excess water in the bowl where you will marinate the chicken. Add in all the chilis and lemon juice first. Let this sit for a few minutes, and then add all the other marination ingredients, such as yogurt, salt, pepper, cumin, coriander, ginger, and more. It is better to place the marinated chicken in the fridge for a few hours. The longer you let it stay in the fridge, the tastier the dish will turn out, as the chicken will soak all the flavor. But if you don’t have much time, marinate the chicken for at least one hour and go ahead with the rest of the recipe. After marinating the chicken, you have to get on with cooking it. Take a large pan or pot and put it on medium heat. Add the required amount of oil and wait for it to heat up. After the oil heats up, add in the chicken pieces, a few at a time. Make sure not to add all the chicken at once, or they might not cook well. Cook the chicken on both sides, letting both sides turn brown, or cook for 2-3 minutes on each side. Take it out once done and set aside. In the same pan, add the mentioned amount of butter and a large red onion diced into pieces. Also, add one cinnamon stick for enhanced flavor. Let them cook for 5-6 minutes or until the onions turn brown. After frying the onions in butter, add cumin, ginger, garlic, garam masala, and chilis into the mix. Let it cook for another minute to soak the taste. Then add tomato paste, salt, pepper, and chicken broth into the mix. Cook this mixture and let it simmer until it turns into a thick sauce. You can also blend this sauce mixture in a blender to give a smooth consistency. Add water if necessary. Once you have got the sauce right, add in the chicken you fried earlier and mix it well with the sauce. Now add the last ingredient, which is cream, and let the mixture simmer for 8-10 minutes. For the last step, chop some fresh cilantro over the meal for garnishing. You can also add slices of lemon for added aesthetics. Serve this with bread, rice, or salad for a hearty meal.

Add the chicken, as well as any extra chicken skin or jelly in the bag to the pot. In the stockpot cover the chicken with water, normally about 3 - 4 quarts.

Boil the chicken and tea ball for 45 - 55 minutes. The chicken meat should separate from the bone very easily. Let cool and strain with sieve all of the stock into a separate bowl or pot. Pick out any inedible chicken parts with your hands. Combine the edible parts of the chicken with carrots, celery, remaining onion and the tea ball with the stock back into an empty pot.

If the pan starts to smoke at any point, simply lower the heat. I always cook my bacon on medium low heat. Once bacon is done, blot with a paper towel to absorb excess grease, then chop into bite sized pieces and set aside. While the bacon is cooking, place a large pot of water over high heat and add in a generous amount of salt. Once water boils, stir in the orzo and cook until al dente about 7-9 minutes.

Next add 1 tablespoon butter to the same pot you cooked the pasta in and place over medium heat. Once butter is melted, add in minced garlic, carrot, corn, red bell pepper and saute for 2 minutes. Next add in spinach; cooking until the spinach wilts, about 2 minutes. Add the cooked orzo back into the pot and turn the heat to low. Stir in the reserved pasta water, parmesan, garlic powder and red chili pepper flakes. Finally, stir in bacon crumbles. Add salt and pepper to taste.
