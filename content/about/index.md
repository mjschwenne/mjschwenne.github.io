## Background

I am currently a first year Ph.D student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison studying computer science.
Before moving to Madison, I got my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Michigan Technological University, graduating in December 2022.
Currently I am a head teaching assistant in CS 400, Programming III this semester after being a standard teaching assistant last semester.
While at Michigan Tech, I served as a Learning Center Coach for four semesters, Teaching Assistant for two semesters, and a Lab Instructor for one semester.
During the summer of 2021, I participated in the Google Summer of Code by working with [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) on implementing an Asymmetric Traveling Salesperson Problem approximation algorithm.
Blog posts from that project are available on the [Scientific Python blog](https://blog.scientific-python.org/tags/traveling-salesman-problem/).
The next summer, I was part of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program funded through the National Science Foundation.
Working with [Dr. Satish Puri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satish-puri-a994a71a/), I developed an multi-threaded C++ system for finding the approximate nearest neighbor for polygons.
For more information, check out the [poster](reu-poster-schwennesen.pdf) or [report](reu-report-schwennesen.pdf) from the project.
Ultimately we decided not to pursue publication for the project since the the C++ implementation did not meet our performance targets.

For more information, please see my [curriculum vitae](cv-schwennesen.pdf) or [résumé](resume-schwennesen.pdf).

## Research Interests

My pervious summer research projects both involved approximation algorithms, which is still a topic of interest for me.
However, recently I've been exploring programming languages as a research area.
In particular, through my experiences as a teaching assistant and coach for computer science students, I've developing an interest in how we can use methods from programming languages research to help students write better code and assess the behavior of a peice of code in a safe way.
Given those two interests, I am eager to learn more about static analysis techniques and program verification as ways to pursue this goal.
Since several program analysis goals are NP-Complete or even undeciable, approximation will likely still play a role in this work.
Through my work with NetworkX and several graph theory classes at Michigan Tech, graph theory is another passion of mine and I would like to explore how graphs and particularly trees can be used in these problems.

## Moving Forward

Right now, I'm looking for connecting with the professors at UW-Madison to find potential advisors and join a research group.
After getting a Ph.D, I'd like to stay in academia and become a professor myself.
While working at Michigan Tech in a variety of student-facing roles, I developed a passion for teaching and sharing my knowledge with other students.
Education has been an important life-long journey for me and I would like to share that with other students.

## Other Interests

Outside of my academia interests, I am passionate about open source software, which I believe is important for a private and secure digital experience.
In my free time, I enjoy playing tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons or Stars Without Number, watching movies, exploring the outdoors and cooking.
You can even find a collection of recipes on this website.
