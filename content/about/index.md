## Background

I am currently an incoming Ph.D student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison studying computer science. 
Before moving to Madison, I got my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Michigan Technological University, graduating in December 2022.
While at Michigan Tech, I served as a Learning Center Coach for four semesters, Teaching Assistant for two semesters, and a Lab Instructor for one semester. 
During the summer of 2021, I participated in the Google Summer of Code by working with [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) on implementing an Asymmetric Traveling Salesperson Problem algorithm.
The next summer, I was part of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program funded through the National Science Foundation. 
Working with [Dr. Satish Puri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satish-puri-a994a71a/), I developed an multi-threaded C++ system for finding the [approximate nearest neighbor for polygons](reu-poster-schwennesen.pdf). 

For more information, please see my [resume](resume-schwennesen.pdf).

## Research Interests 

My experiences with the research projects over the last two summers have developed my interest in approximation algorithms. 
In particular, the REU had me working on a fundamental problem in machine learning and data science: the nearest neighbor problem. 
I believe that approximation algorithms will play a critical role in the future of computing, as the amount of data available seems to be growing faster than available computing power. 
Through my work with NetworkX and several graph theory classes at Michigan Tech, graph theory is another passion of mine and I would like to explore how graphs can be used aid in approximate algorithms.

## Moving Forward

Right now, I'm looking for connecting with the professors at UW-Madison to find potential advisors. 
After getting a Ph.D, I'd like to stay in academia and become a professor myself. 
While working at Michigan Tech in a variety of student-facing roles, I developed a passion for teaching and sharing my knowledge with other students. 
Education has been an important life-long journey for me and I would like to share that with other students. 

## Other Interests

Outside of my academia interests, I am passionate about open source software, which I believe is important for a private and secure digital experience. 
In my free time, I enjoy playing tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons or Pathfinder, and you can actually find information on this site relating to my games.
