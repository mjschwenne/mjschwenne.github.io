## Background

I am currently a second year Ph.D student at the University of Wisconsin,
Madison studying computer science. I'm working on formal verification of
software as part of the [madPL](https://madpl.cs.wisc.edu/) group with my
advisor [Tej Chajed](https://www.chajed.io/). 

Before moving to Madison, I got my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at
Michigan Technological University, graduating in December 2022. Previously, I
was a head teaching assistant in CS 400, Programming III after being a standard
teaching assistant my first semester in Wisconsin. While at Michigan Tech, I
served as a Learning Center Coach for four semesters, Teaching Assistant for two
semesters, and a Lab Instructor for one semester. During the summer of 2021, I
participated in the Google Summer of Code by working with
[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) on implementing an Asymmetric Traveling
Salesperson Problem approximation algorithm. Blog posts from that project are
available on the [Scientific Python
blog](https://blog.scientific-python.org/tags/traveling-salesman-problem/). The
next summer, I was part of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
program funded through the National Science Foundation. Working with [Dr. Satish
Puri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satish-puri-a994a71a/), I developed a
multi-threaded C++ system for finding the approximate nearest neighbor for
polygons. Last summer, I overhauled the graph visualization API in NetworkX,
moving to an API design were all information is read off the graph directly.

For more information, please see my [curriculum vitae](cv-schwennesen.pdf).

## Research Interests

My research interests lay in program verification, roughly speaking how we can
formally prove that programs behave correctly under all circumstances. My
current project seeks to reason about software updates, ensuring that a new
version of the program can successfully interpret persistent state and handle
interactions with the environment in a compatible way with the old version of
the program. Before that I worked on
[`grackle`](https://github.com/mjschwenne/grackle), a program which generated
validated or proof-instrumented data marshaling and unmarshaling `go`
code. Though this process, I'm been learning more about proof assistants,
specifically `coq` (soon be to known as `rocq`). My venture into the field of
programming languages has been extremely rewarding, blending all of the aspects
I love about theory with practical applications about how we can reason about
the behavior of programs.

## Other Interests

Computer science education is a secondary topic of interest for me. While
working with students over the last 4 years, I've seen a lot of different
methods to teach students computer science concepts and how they develop those
concepts into programs. Often, too much emphasis is placed on the final result
or program behavior, while ignoring the development progress itself.

Outside of my academia interests, I am passionate about open source software,
which I believe is important for a private and secure digital experience. In my
free time, I enjoy playing tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons &
Dragons or Stars Without Number, watching movies, exploring the outdoors and
cooking. You can even find a collection of recipes on this website.
