## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   Bisquik
-   black pepper
-   1-1/2 cups buttermilk
-   cayenne pepper
-   5 chicken
-   6 boneless breasts
-   1/2 cups cornmeal
-   1-1/2 cups flour
-   2 tbsp hot sauce
-   oil
-   old bay
-   1 tsp paprika
-   salt


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Cut up chicken into about 4 peices each, sprinkle with salt and black
    pepper. Combine buttermilk and hot sauce in a gallon ziplock bag. Add chicken
    and keep in fridge at least 4 hours, better overnight.
2.  Prepare chicken for frying. Create two stations with shallow tupperware. Pour
    the bag with the buttermilk mixture and chicken into the first station and in
    the other mix flour, cornmeal, paprika and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper
    (optional). Add salt and black pepper to taste. Mix well. Take the chicken
    from the buttermilk mixture and coat with flour mixture. It should be
    lumpy. Set aside pieces.
3.  Heat a coating of oil in a large skillet at medium high heat. Once hot, place
    chicken in pan and cook each side for 3 minutes. Hints: use a timer and do
    NOT move or touch it once it hits the pan. If you do, you will lost all of
    the breading. If using a deep fryer, drop the chicken into the oil with the
    basket submerged rather then place it in the basket before submerging it for
    the same reason. Once golden brown, you can keep it hot in an oven warmed to
    250 degrees.
4.  Meanwhile, make the waffles according to Bisquik instructions. I highly
    recommend adding some old bay to the waffle mix for the extra, savory flavor.
5.  Add your favorite toppings. Popular choices are syrup, peanut butter, red
    pepper jelly, butter, mustard and barbecue sauce.
