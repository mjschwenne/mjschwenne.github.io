## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   6 cups apple cider
-   1/4 cup real maple syrup
-   2 cinnamon sticks
-   6 whole cloves
-   6 whole allspice berries
-   1 orange peel, cut into strips
-   1 lemon peel, cut into strips
-   Brandy, if desired


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Pour apple cider and maple syrup into a large stainless steel saucepan.
2.  Place cinnamon sticks, cloves, allspice berries, orange peel, and lemon peel in the center of a square of washed cheesecloth; fold up the sides of the cheesecloth to enclose the bundle, then tie it up with a length of kitchen string. Drop the spice bundle into the cider mixture.
3.  Place the saucepan over moderate heat and cook until cider is very hot but not boiling, about 5 to 10 minutes.
4.  Remove cider from the heat. Discard the spice bundle.
5.  Ladle cider into big cups or mugs, adding a fresh cinnamon stick to each serving if desired.
