## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   8 ounces broccoli florets
-   1 tbsp brown sugar
-   1 pound chicken breasts
-   1/3 cups chicken stock
-   1 tbsp cornstarch
-   2 green onions
-   1 tbsp minced garlic
-   2 tbsp oil
-   pepper
-   1 pack ramen noodles
-   1 tbsp rice vinegar
-   salt
-   1 tbsp sesame seeds
-   1/4 cups soy sauce
-   water


## Directions {#directions}

1.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the soy sauce and cornstarch until no
    lumps remain. Add chicken stock, rice vinegar, brown sugar and minced
    garlic. Whisk until evenly combined.
2.  Heat a pot of water in until steaming. Add ramen noodles but discard the
    flavor packet and soak until just tender. When noodles are tender, drain.
3.  While noodles soak, toss chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
4.  Heat a wok or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add oil and then the
    chicken. Saute until chicken is cooked through, 5 minutes. Set aside.
5.  Return wok to medium-high heat. Add oil and then broccoli florets. Saute
    broccoli until it turns bright green and then continue cooking until broccoli
    is tender.
6.  Add sauce to the pan and toss to coat broccoli. Continue cooking until sauce
    reduces slightly, 2 minutes.
7.  Add chicken and noodles to the pan and toss everything to coat in sauce.
8.  Remove from heat and add green onions and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.
