## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   1 rotisserie chicken
-   1 package fresh poultry herbs
-   1 medium onion, diced
-   1 red bell pepper, julienne cut
-   3/4 box mini farfalle pasta
-   4 carrots, diced
-   3 celery stalks, diced
-   1 tbsp vegetable oil
-   salt
-   pepper
-   old bay seasoning


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Prepare the stock pot. With a small amount of vegetable oil saute about 1/2
    of the onion in the bottom of the pot. It should just start to turn brown,
    translucent and soften. Set aside until the chicken is ready. I recommend a
    past pot to keep chicken off the bottom of the pot.
2.  Break down the chicken with your hands into about 8 - 12 pieces. Add the
    chicken, as well as any extra chicken skin or jelly in the bag to the pot.
3.  In the stockpot cover the chicken with water, normally about 3 - 4 quarts.
4.  Chop the poultry herbs and place in either a large tea ball or cheese cloth
    wrap. You can also crush the herbs in a mortar and pestle before being placed
    in the tea ball. Add to stockpot.
5.  Boil the chicken and tea ball for 45 - 55 minutes. The chicken meat should
    separate from the bone very easily.
6.  Let cool and strain with sieve all of the stock into a separate bowl or pot.
7.  Pick out any inedible chicken parts with your hands.
8.  Combine the edible parts of the chicken with carrots, celery, remaining onion
    and the tea ball with the stock back into an empty pot.
9.  Bring to a boil again and simmer again for 30 minutes tasting and seasoning
    to taste.
10. Add red bell pepper and pasta noodles. Simmer for another 20 minutes,
    tasting again and seasoning as needed.
11. Serve, often with shredded cheese and a dinner roll.

_Note: often the noodles will continue to absorb any broth. Leftovers will_
_become a very hearty chicken noodle stew. The soup reaches peak flavor the day_
_after it was made._
