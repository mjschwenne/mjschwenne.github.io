-   2-1/2 cups chicken stock
-   2 ribs chopped celery
-   3 diced carrots
-   1/2 cup heavy cream
-   2 tsp salt
-   1 tsp pepper
-   1/2 tsp thyme


### Dumplings {#dumplings}

-   pam


## Directions {#directions}


### Chicken Base {#chicken-base}

1.  Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Then cut the chicken into
    strips.
2.  Melt 4 tbs butter in a large pot and cook the chicken about 5 minutes per
    side until golden.
3.  Remove from pan and set aside. To the same pot, add chopped onion and cook
    until tender, about 5 minutes. Add and melt 4 tbs butter.
4.  Add flour and cook for 1 minute. Temperature here is critical. If it is too
    hot the flour will burn and ruin the whole dish.
5.  Whisk in the chicken stock and bring to a boil, then add diced carrots,
    chopped celery, thyme, salt and pepper.
6.  Return the chicken to the pot. Reduce to a simmer and cover with lid. Cook on
    low for 25 minutes.
7.  Add heavy cream and dumplings.
8.  Put a clear pie plate over the pot and cook for another 15 minutes. Then
    check that the dumplings are cooked using a knife until the dough comes out
    clean.


### Dumplings {#dumplings}

_This recipe is a double batch._

1.  In a 2 cup measure, break both eggs and fill the rest of the cup with milk.
2.  Beat well and stir into the dry ingredients, flour, baking powder, salt. The
    dough will be incredibly sticky so apply pam to your hands to work with the
    dough.
3.  Add rosemary to the dumpling dough. Other herbs can be added at your
    discretion.
4.  Form the dough into balls with an ice cream scoop and drop directly on top
    of the chicken base. Make sure each dumpling is in contact with the sauce.
