## Directions {#directions}

1.  Wash the chicken and pat dry with paper towel, then remove any excess water
    in the bowl or bag where the chicken will marinate.
2.  Add in all the chilis and lemon juice first. Let this sit for a few minutes,
    and then add all the other marination ingredients.
3.  Marinate the chicken in the fridge for at least an hour.
4.  After marinating the chicken, take a large pan or pot, add the oil and put it
    on medium heat.
5.  After the oil heats up, add in the chicken pieces. Cook the chicken for 2-3
    minutes on each side. Take it out once done and set aside.
6.  In the same pan, add the butter and red onion. Also add the cinnamon and
    cook for 5-6 minutes or until the onions turn brown.
7.  After frying the onions in butter, add cumin, ginger, garlic, garam masala,
    and chilis into the mix. Let it cook for another minute.
8.  Then add tomato paste, salt, pepper, and chicken broth into the mix. Cook
    this mixture and let it simmer until it turns into a thick sauce. You can
    also blend this sauce mixture in a blender to give a smooth consistency. Add
    water if necessary.
9.  Return the chicken to the pan and mix it well with the sauce. Now add the
    cream and let the mixture simmer for 8-10 minutes.
10. Chop some fresh cilantro for garnishing. You can also add slices of lemon for
    added aesthetics.
11. Serve this with bread, rice, or salad.
