### Dough {#dough}

-   1/2 cup granulated sugar
-   1 cup warm milk (115 F)
-   1 package active yeast
-   5 tbsp buffer, softened
-   2 eggs
-   1 tsp salt
-   4 cups flour


### Filling {#filling}

-   1 cup packed light brown sugar
-   2 tbsp cinnamon


### Caramel Sauce {#caramel-sauce}

-   6 tbsp butter
-   1-1/4 cups light brown sugar
-   3 tbsp milk or cream
-   1 tsp vanilla
-   1 cup pecans (optional)


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Put sugar in bowl with warm milk and mixed slightly.
2.  Add yeast and let set about 5 minutes until the yeast foams up a little.
3.  Add softened butter, eggs, salt and 1/2 cup flour to make a batter.
4.  Add the rest of the flour gradually, scraping the sides of the bowl to fully
    incorporate. The dough will be very soft. Turn it out onto a floured surface
    and knead by hand **gently**. Do not over knead, knead just enough for the dough
    to form a smooth ball.
5.  Put dough in vegetable oil greased bowl turning dough so it is greased on all
    sides. Cover with plastic wrap and put in a warm place to raise.
6.  For the caramel sauce, melt butter, brown sugar and milk in a pan. Don't raise
    to a boil until the sugar is fully dissolved. Keep stirring so it doesn't
    stick.
7.  Pour into a greased 13x9 inch baking dish, spreading evenly.
8.  Carefully turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Gently knead.
9.  Roll or pat dough into a 16 x 20 inch rectangle.
10. Spread soft butter on top of dough and sprinkle evenly with mixed filling of
    brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the buttered dough.
11. Roll the dough into a gentle but snug jelly roll.
12. Cut into 12 pieces and place in pan on top of caramel sauce.
13. Bake at 375 F for 18 - 25 minutes.
14. When done, spread hot rolls with butter and let set 10 minutes before
    turning out onto a cookie sheet.
15. Put into an air tight container or wrap in newspaper.
