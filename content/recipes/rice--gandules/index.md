-   1-1/2 tsp sazón con achiote y culantro

## Directions {#directions}

1.  Heat large pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Add olive oil, ham or bacon
    and sofrito. Stir constantly until fragrant and tender, but not
    browned. About of 4 minutes.
2.  Next add the sazón, tomato paste and chicken bouillon. Stir to combine.
3.  Add the drained pigeon peas, italian seasoning, bay leaves and broth. Add the
    cilantro and olives. Allow the liquid to come to a boil and taste for
    salt. If more salt is required, add another bouillon cube.
4.  Once the mixture is boiling, add the rice. Stir the rice to get it submerged
    and distribute the pigeon peas throughout.
5.  Cover and allow the rice to absorb all the visible liquid. Once most of the
    visible liquid is absorbed, stir the rice and cover again. Lower the heat to
    low and allow it to steam for 20 - 25 minutes. It's done with all the liquid
    absorbed and the grains are fluffy and fully cooked.
