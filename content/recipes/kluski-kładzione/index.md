## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   2 eggs
-   3 cups flour
-   oil
-   2 tbsp, 1/4 tsp salt
-   1-1/4 cups water


## Directions {#directions}

1.  In a small bowl, beat eggs to mix yolks and white. Place flour in a large
    mixing bowl, add eggs and salt. Slowly start adding water and beat on low
    until blended well.
2.  Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Add salt and some oil to the
    water.
3.  With a metal spoon, form dumplings the size of a walnut and drop them into
    the boiling water by submerging the spoon in the water. Once dumplings are
    dropped, with a wooden spoon gently stir the water to make sure the dumplings
    aren't sticking together.
4.  Turn water to a low simmer and boil for 4 minutes from the moment they float
    to the top.
5.  Remove with a hand strainer and place on a colander. Sprinkle with a tiny bit
    of oil to prevent from sticking, if not serving right away.
