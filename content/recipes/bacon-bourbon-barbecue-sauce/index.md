## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   2 strips bacon, finely diced
-   1-1/2 cups apple cider vinegar
-   2-1/2 cups ketchup
-   1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
-   1/4 cup granulated sugar
-   2 tbs red pepper flakes
-   2 tbs freshly ground black pepper
-   1/2 cup bourbon
-   salt


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Place the bacon in a heavy, non-reactive saucepan. Cook over medium heat
    until the bacon is browned, 3 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon.
2.  Stir in the vinegar and bring to a boil.
3.  Stir in ketchup, sugars, red pepper flakes, black pepper and bourbon, then
    slowly return to a boil.
4.  Reduce the heat and simmer the sauce, uncovered, until thick and richly
    flavored, 15-20 minutes.
5.  Stir in the salt, you'll need quite a bit to offset the acidity of the
    vinegar.
6.  Use right away or transfer to clean jars, cover, cool to room temperature and
    refrigerate.
7.  The sauce should keep for several weeks.
