## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   4 chicken breast
-   croutons
-   1 lemon
-   1 tbsp minced garlic
-   1/2 cups olive oil
-   parmesan cheese
-   pepper
-   4 romaine lettuce heats
-   salt


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Make a dressing by combining minced garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper and the
    juice from a lemon. Mix well, then set aside.
2.  Heat the grill or grill pan.
3.  Take the chicken breast and season each side with salt and pepper. Then add
    about a teaspoon of dressing to each breast to coat.
4.  Slice romaine lettuce heats down the middle, keeping the stem so that it
    stays together. Add about a teaspoon of dressing to each lettuce half.
5.  Grill chicken until cooked. Grill lettuce for about 1 minute each side. Cut
    up the lettuce and chicken into bite sized salad pieces and place them in a
    serving bowl. Add remaining dressing and mix well.
6.  Serve with croutons and parmesan.
