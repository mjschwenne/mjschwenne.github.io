## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   1 lb. ground beef
-   3 cloves garlic
-   1 onion, finely chopped
-   1 bell pepper, chopped
-   1 packet taco seasoning
-   1 tbs chili powder
-   1 tsp ground cumin
-   15oz can black beans, drained and rinsed
-   14oz can chicken broth
-   10oz can rotel
-   8oz can tomato sauce
-   1 cup water


## Directions {#directions}

This recipe instructs you to brown the beef on the stove, but I believe that you
could do it in the instant pot itself using the saute mode.

1.  On the stove, brown the ground beef.
2.  Once browned, add chopped onion, bell pepper and garlic. Cook for 3 minutes.
3.  Add taco seasoning, chili powder and cumin.
4.  Transfer the meat mixture to the instant pot.
5.  Add beans, chicken broth, rotel, tomato sauce and water. Stir to combine.
6.  Cook on high pressure for 10 minutes, then let the pressure release naturally
    for 10 minutes.
7.  Serve with your favorite toppings, like shredded cheese, avocado slices or fritos.
