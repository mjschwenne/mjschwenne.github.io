> Editor's Note: I'm not sure why this recipe is called "City Chicken". To the
> best of my knowledge it does not contain any chicken.

1.  Thread 2 - 3 cubes of pork onto each skewer and sprinkle with salt and
    pepper. Set aside.
2.  Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl. Place bread crumbs in another bowl.
3.  Heat the oil in a deep sided skillet.
4.  Dip each skewer of pork into the egg mixture and then the bread crumbs, then
    carefully repeat the process again after all skewers have been dipped once.
5.  Gently lay skewers into the hot oil and brown until coating is crisp and
    golden, about 3 minutes per side.
6.  Once the skewers are all browned, set on a wire rack in baking dish and pour
    water in bottom. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes at 350 F.
7.  Remove foil and bake another 10 minutes to dry out the crumb coating.
