## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   1 medium onion
-   2 cloves garlic
-   1 pound green cabbage
-   2 medium carrots
-   1 tbsp olive oil
-   1 pound ground beef
-   1-1/2 tsp paprika
-   1 tsp salt
-   1/4 tsp pepper
-   32 ounces beef broth
-   1 can diced tomato
-   8 oz tomato sauce
-   1 cup water
-   2 tbsp brown sugar
-   1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
-   1 tsp apple cider vinegar
-   1 bay leaf
-   1/2 cups white rice
-   2 tbsp fresh parsley


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Dice medium onion, mince garlic and place both in the same bowl.
2.  Core and chop green cabbage into 1-inch pieces.
3.  Peel and dice medium carrots and place both into a second bowl.
4.  Heat olive oil in a large pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat until
    shimmering.
5.  Add the onion and garlic, ground beef and paprika. Then add salt, pepper and
    cook, breaking up the meat until the beef is cooked, about 10 minutes.
6.  Add beef broth and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan with
    a wooden spoon.
7.  Add diced tomato, water, brown sugar, worcestershire sauce, apple cider
    vinegar and a bay leaf. Stir to combine and bring to a boil over high heat.
8.  Add the cabbage, carrot and white rice. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer
    and cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice and cabbage are tender, about
    30 minutes.
9.  Meanwhile coarsely chop fresh parsley.
10. Discard the bay leaf. Taste and season the soup with more salt and pepper as
    needed.
