## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   4 tbsp butter
-   1/4 cups cocoa
-   1/2 cups peanut butter
-   3 cups quick oats
-   2 cups sugar
-   2 tsp vanilla


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Combine sugar, butter, cocoa and bring to a slow boil.
2.  Turn off heat and add vanilla and peanut butter, then mix well until creamy
    and smooth before adding quick oats.
3.  Drop by spoonful onto wax paper to set. These can be put in the fridge to
    speed the setting, but they will harden with time on the counter.
