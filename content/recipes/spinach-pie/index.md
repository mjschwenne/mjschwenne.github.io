## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   1 small jar artichokes
-   6 tbsp butter
-   4 ounces cream cheese
-   1 cup heavy cream
-   1 tbsp minced garlic
-   1 onion
-   pam
-   1/4 cups parmesan cheese
-   pepper
-   2 sheets puff pastry
-   1 tsp salt
-   5 ounces spinach


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2.  Take out puff pastry and bring it to room temperature, then spray a 13x9 pan
    with pam.
3.  Use a rolling pin to flatten out the pastry once it is soft enough to work
    with so that it will fit in the pan. Set aside.
4.  Take the onion, cut in it half and peel. Slice it into thin strips.
5.  Drain artichokes and cut into small pieces. Note some of the outer leaves
    will be tough, get rid of them.
6.  Melt butter in a large saucepan.
7.  Add minced garlic and onion to the saucepan and cook for 3 minutes.
8.  Add artichokes and stir.
9.  Add heavy cream and bring to a boil.
10. Reduce to a simmer and let thicken for about 2 minutes.
11. Season with salt and pepper.
12. Stir in cream cheese and parmesan cheese until smooth and creamy.
13. Add spinach and cook, stirring for about 2 minutes until it all wilts
    down. Then set aside.
14. Go back to the pastry. Place one of the puff pastry sheets on the bottom,
    them melt butter in the microwave and brush the bottom pastry layer.
15. Add the spinach mixture, then put on the top pastry layer and seal the
    edges.
16. Brush with remaining butter, then bake for 40 minutes until pastry is puffy
    and golden brown.
