## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   12 oz chicken broth
-   48 oz water
-   3 carrots
-   2 lbs roasted sausage
-   3 celery stalks
-   1 large onion
-   3-1/2 cups potatoes, diced
-   2 tbsp flour
-   1 cup milk
-   2 cup sour cream
-   salt
-   pepper


## Directions {#directions}

1.  In a large pot, combine chicken broth and water with diced celery, diced
    carrots, diced onion and potatoes.
2.  Cook until potatoes can be stabbed with a fork.
3.  In another sauce pan, slice roasted sausage, cover with water, and cook about
    25 minutes.
4.  In separate bowl, mix flour, milk and sour cream until smooth.
5.  Add sausage along with water to the vegetable pot.
6.  Temper the milk and sour cream with some of the broth from vegetables (this
    will keep the sour cream and milk from curdling) then add it to the soup and
    heat thoroughly.
