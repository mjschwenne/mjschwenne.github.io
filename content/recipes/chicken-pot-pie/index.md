## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   3 cups frozen mixed vegetables
-   1 cup potatoes, peeled and diced
-   1 cup chopped celery
-   1 onion
-   2/3 cup butter
-   2/3 cup all purpose flour
-   1 tsp salt
-   1 tsp pepper
-   1/2 tsp celery seed
-   1/2 tsp onion powder
-   1/2 tsp italian seasoning
-   1-3/4 cup chicken broth
-   1-1/3 cup milk
-   4 cups cooked shredded chicken
-   4 9-inch unbaked pie crusts


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Preheat oven to 425 F.
2.  Place the mixed vegetables and celery into a saucepan, cover with
    water. Bring to a boil and simmer over medium-low heat until the celery and
    potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Drain the vegetables in a colander and
    set aside.
3.  Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat and cook diced onion until
    translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, celery seed, onion
    powder and italian seasoning. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and milk
    until the mixture comes to a simmer and thickens.
4.  Remove from heat, stir in cooked vegetables and chicken to create the pie
    filling.
5.  Transfer half of the filling to a pie dough lined pie plate. Add the top
    crust, pinch edges and cut slits into the top. Brush with cream or milk if
    desired.
6.  Let the remaining filling cool, then transfer it to a gallon sized freezer
    bag and freeze. When ready to use, thaw and warm the filling in a saucepan
    before assembling the pie as described in step 5.
7.  Place a foil ring around the e4dge crusts. Bake in the preheated oven until
    the crusts are golden brown and the filling is bubbly, normally 30 - 35
    minutes. If the crusts are browning too quickly, cover the pie with aluminum
    foil after about 15 minutes.
8.  Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
