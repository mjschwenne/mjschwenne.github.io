## Ingredients {#ingredients}

-   4 eggs
-   3/4 cup sugar
-   1/2 cup flour
-   1/3 cup cocoa
-   1 tsp baking powder
-   1/4 tsp salt.


## Directions {#directions}

1.  Separate eggs, put white in a large bowl. Let stand at room temperature for 30
    minutes. Line a greased 15x10 inch baking pan with waxed paper; grease the
    paper and set aside.
2.  In a large bowl, beat egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar on high speed for 5 minutes
    or until thick and lemon-colored. Sift the flour, cocoa, baking powder and
    salt together gradually add to the yolk mixture and mix well. (Batter will be
    very thick)
3.  In a large bowl with clean beaters, beat egg whites on medium speed until
    soft peaks form. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tbsp at a time, on high
    speed until stiff peaks form. Stir the whites into batter a little at a
    time. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.
4.  Bake at 375 F for 10 - 12 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly
    touched. Cool for 5 minutes. Invert the cake onto a kitchen towel dusted with
    confectioner's sugar. Gently peel off paper. Roll the cake in towel
    jelly-roll style, starting with a short side. Cool on a wire rack.
5.  Unroll cake and top with softened ice cream. Roll up without towel. Place
    seam side down on a platter. Cover and freeze for at at least 4 hours before
    slicing. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar serve with hot fudge and whipped
    cream.
