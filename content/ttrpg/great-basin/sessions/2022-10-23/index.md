When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

It was the 33rd of Fireharvest and the members of the task force had captured
Marius Kleinheisterkamp and a member of the Keburipemi Syndicate after
successfully taking control of the shipment of Cylex and collecting 84,000 gold
from the bottom of the channel. Through collective rationale, it was decided
that it was too dangerous to take these prisoners back to Kerkrad since their
members of their governments could influence or disrupt the interrogation
process.

The next morning, with Wil absent, the rest of the part formulates
questions for Marius including:

1.  Did you bomb the Forum on the 34th of Goldwave?
2.  What were your plans for the Cylex?
3.  How did you know about the Cylex?
4.  Who is Hans and where can we find him?

Though a pained interrogation conducted by Oisin, the task forced learned that
Marius and his group did not bomb the Forum last month. They were contacted by
the Syndicate about if they would be interested in purchasing the Cylex by
somebody with a moniker starting with a 'V'. Marius claimed that the Cylex was
going to be used solely within the Eichen Kingdom and for purposes not related
to the task force's investigation.

When the conversation turned to his own political ideas, Marius was must more
open. He revealed that he was injured during a covert operation in the Commune
of Atrxous by an explosive that he had personally set and checked. After many
months of recovery, he was discharged from the Eichen military and returned to
investigate the explosion in the Commune. While it was difficult work,
eventually he concluded that the only explanation was deliberate sabotage by
someone with extensive training in Eichen explosives.

Disheartened, he returned to the Kingdom and started talking with other wounded
veterans from the Eichen military and got connected to a similar group. When
they examined the office reports about the injuries released by the government,
the numbers simply did not add up with what their experiences on the streets
said, so they organized and launched an investigation into this manner.

Eventually, deep in the forest, a group of mages reported a strong feeling of
death and intense necrotic magic which "felt like the souls of the damned
fleeing the area". Several more months of reconnaissance helped the group pin
down the location of a secret research facility, underground and heavily
fortified. They were going to use the Cylex to blow in a secondary entrance and
try to take the compound by force.

He also said that Hans was his boss and revealed the location of 37 hideouts
that Hans has set up.

The Syndicate prisoner didn't reveal much information, other than the name of
his supervisor, Bito Takamitsu. He evidently was a low level drug pusher for the
Syndicate and knew nothing about the higher level plans.

Later, when Zorro returned, Oisin mentioned that Marius wanted to discuss
something with him, so he and Zorro went back into the room where Marius was
bound. Marius started asking some though-provoking questions about Zorro's
injuries and his observations about the number of wounded veterans in the
Kingdom. However, when he mentioned using the Cylex to bomb a government
research site, Zorro's sword was engaged and successfully dominated Zorro's
personality in an attempt to kill Marius. Oisin immediately noticed the change
in Zorro and quickly called for Wil while using Color Spray to stun Zorro. While
Wil was able to get into the room and grapple Zorro, it was Redfern who proved
the most useful in apprehending the sword. He summoned a group of monkeys who
swarmed Zorro and disarmed him by taking the sword right out of his hands. While
the monkeys were then overpowered by the will of the sword, Redfern simply
dismissed them, allowing Breagan to pick up the sword and place it in Oisin's
bag of holding.

After that eventful morning, the group packed up and set out back to Kerkrad,
using the wagon from Syndicate and their horses which Redfern thankfully didn't
kill.

After arriving back at Kerkrad on Shimmerfall 3rd, you checked your prisoners
into the Eaton.
