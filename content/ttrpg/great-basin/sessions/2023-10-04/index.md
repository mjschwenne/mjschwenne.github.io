When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

The members of the Task Force were plotting there next move on the coast of the
Commune of Atrxous. You were discussing the finer points of a revolution and how
to remove the compromised actors from the Forum when a sudden slashing sound
from a nearby creek caught your attention. A appeared that a group of bounty
hunters where snooping around for the new bounty on your head. Their leader was
a dwarf in laborers cloths that would be typical in the Commune, along with a
man in a black robe with lightning bolts, what appeared to be a hunter and a
dueler wearing medium armor. You weren't interested in fighting this group, so
Meru attempted to de-escalate the situation by revealing the Sword of
Divinity. While the hunter and the dueler wanted to bail, the dwarf was not
convinced that the sword was real and the situation did indeed escalate when
the figure in robes cast [Chain Lightning](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Chain%20Lightning). Meru acted quickly, and used [Rainbow
Pattern](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Rainbow%20Pattern) to fascinate three of the four bounty hunters, everybody except their
leader. After a brief struggle, he was knocked out and left in the woods after
Meru cast [Stabilize](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Stabilize). They continued to concentration on the Rainbow Pattern to
keep the others occupied and quickly broke camp, using a combination of [Overland
Flight](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Overland%20Flight) and [Wind Walk](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wind%20Walk) to return to Kerkrad.

Once back on the city, you needed a place to lie low for a while. After a quick
debate, Wil re-materialized from the fog and headed for Rokkaku's Ramen to see
if he could provide a safe-house or other nondescript location. Wil, disguised
as "Chad the Fogbringer" in town for the annual fog-surfing champion, ordered
the Rattlesnake Ramen and asked for a safe-house location. Rokkaku delivered and
with the receipt for his ramen, Wil found a street address written on
it. Eventually everybody gathered and coalesced from their gaseous state in the
Syndicate safe-house.

Hoping to gain an information advantage, Meru used their questions to ask about
if Rokkaku was doing to betray them and surprising he wasn't. You also learned
that Eaton was not compromised by LAKE but hadn't learned of your current
whereabouts. Using Jusa's [Divination](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Divination), you learned that Eaton would meet with you
in good faith, Marchi Elenek would seek a safe guard, Ikoma Sakome can't learn
about your connection to the Syndicate and the Breagan would be a wild card.

We now resume late on the night of Whitermire 17 as you plot how to meet up with
Eaton and the other members who you've identified as being critical for a coup.
