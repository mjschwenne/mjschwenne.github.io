Welcome to the epilogue for the Great Basin, a Pathfiner 1E game that I've been
running for just over two years!

Now that the game is officially over, I can divulge some secretes and resolve
the long-term plot points. As a reminder, the [last session]({{< relref
"/ttrpg/great-basin/sessions/2023-11-29" >}}) saw the death most of the task
force, with only Gwen and Meru surviving. Meru had to bargain with Kieros for
protection, agreeing to become a mouthpiece for her and advance her will across
the basin.

As such, the charismatic oracle Meru becomes _the_ leading political figure in the
aftermath of the destruction of the League Against Koncord Eminence. It takes
about two months for them to rebuild Forum and the Bastion of the Sky. During
this time, their powerful divination abilities reveal that the long-feared
invasion of the basin by the Caerwent Empire was still about a year way. The
earlier time table was a false positive caused by a misunderstanding of how long
it takes to mobilize a full-scale invasion force. During this time, Meru has to
focus on unity and military strong, knowing that the Caerwent Empire will test
the might of basin like it has never been tested before. Notable events in this
time period include:

-   Stopping a plot by Janus Brutus to take over the Empire of Xylte. As it turns
    out, Silvius Albina (the elderly delegate from Xylte who was racist against
    Oisin) was not *totally* senile as he was under some powerful hexes cast by
    Janus. She was planning to create a hostile military junta before expanding
    and conquering the Commune of Atrxous.
-   Meru learns that Niwa Sura, leader of the Keburipemi Syndicate is planing to
    over-throw the Emperor of the Niven Imperium within the next year. The Niven
    government was actually ruled by a group of immortal samurai, blessed by a
    powerful grove of Kami, who seized power from Niwa's ancestor. Meru, weary of
    provoking an old ally, powerful crime-boss and assassin, negotiates with her
    to delay the coup until after the Caerwent Empire has been dealt with in
    exchange for Meru's soft support later.
-   The Eichen Kingdom was doing research into binding souls to siege
    weapons. This process requires a strong connection between the souls and the
    weapons, which is why the Kingdom was sabotaging their own weapons to create
    that bond with the injured soldiers. This is how Zorro was injured and
    discharged from the Eichen military. Despite the usefulness that sentient,
    highly magical siege weapons would have in the coming conflict, the Koncord
    stepped in, ended the program and exiled the leadership responsible.

Soon, the forces of the Caerwent Empire reached the Basin. Rather than fight a
head-to-head battle against superior force, or attempting a counter-offensive
into Caerwent territory, Meru recommended a Guerrilla strategy involving
numerous faints, retreats and defensive fortifications. Eventually, the
conflict ground to a halt and Meru was able to force the Emperor to the
negotiating table. After a year of conflict, a treaty was signed and a new
border was established just outside the Basin.

In the years after the war with the Caerwent Empire, Meru and the rest of the
Koncord shifted to create a prosperous and egalitarian land. Notable events
include:

-   Keeping an oath and helping Niwa take the throne of the Niven Imperium, while
    also influencing her into exiling the current cabal rather than executing
    them.
-   Learning that Arendelle was run by a shadow government of planar-touched
    humans on a mission to control and contain the four Elemental
    Beasts. Individual members tended to operate as bounty hunters around the
    basin, but they were largely uninterested in actually governing their nation,
    resulting in higher poverty and disease rates.
-   Ændor was freed from the Empire of Xylte, along with one of their other pieces
    of conquered land, Roga. In fact, the Empire as it existed during the last
    session no longer exists, replaced by a more democratic government operating
    under the careful supervision of the Koncord. Gwen became instrumental and
    helping gather the scattered Andorian Elves from around the basin and even
    outside the basin, where an exclave in the mountains was located. Without any
    members of the royal family left after Oisin's death, the elves decided to
    form a Greek-style direct democracy. Eventually Gwen returned to the
    Underdark, but kept in touch with Meru via magic.
-   Dauntless was tracked down, and revealed to be Diana Drache, the doctor who
    restored Meru's memory. Since she had not causes any disturbances since LAKE
    fell, she was "imprisoned" in a remote area of the Eichen Kingdom and bound
    from leaving a area several square miles in size. Eventually, she became almost
    a confidant to Meru a place were they could go to escape all the activity
    required to run the Basin.
-   Timer bis zur Erlösung, a spinning collection of stones in the Eichen Kingdom
    was revealed to be an artifact left by the Caerwent that had survived The
    Shattering.

After several decades of peace and prosperity, an aging Meru began to
contemplate how to preserve the peace after their death. They decided that the
systems and institutions they had built over their long and storied career were
stable so long as the Sword of Divinity remained protected and safe. Kieros had
proved to be a powerful ally, but it was difficult even for Meru sometimes to
resist her calls for violence against the enemies of the basin and Koncord. Meru
was concerned that eventually the basin would collapse into dictatorship ruled by
whoever could wield the sword, so before their death, Meru hid the sword and
traveled the basin, leaving hints as to it's rest place before passing into the
next realm them self.

Who knows if we will even learn more about what happened in the Great Basin.
