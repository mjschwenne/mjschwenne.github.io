When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

The members of the Task Force where holed up in a safe-house provided to them by
Rokkaku Nakateru, the propitiator of Rokkaku's Ramen. Even though it was late
into the night, you were all up discussing your actions for the next day. You
eventually decide to use [Sending](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Sending) to meet with Eaton at the Temple of Korina on
Kerkard.

> From Task Force: Meet us at the church of Kronia at 11am, We have information for
> you regarding LAKE. Meet empty hands in good faith.

Eaton's response is a single word:

> Acknowledged.

The next morning, Zorro, Redfern and Wil are sure to arrive at the temple early,
using [Wind Walk](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wind%20Walk) to traverse the skies and avoid being spotted around the temple
until Eaton gets there. Once he arrives, a full 15 minutes early, you get down
to business. They tell Eaton about discovering Vessimur Yutros' true identity as
Ambition, about Oisin's death and that you were able to recover the sword. In
response, Eaton tells you that the vote to disband the Task Force and set a
bounty on you was a shocking 0 - 20, which is unheard of for the Forum. He also
says that the vote was taken behind closed doors and all of the questions that
he's asked to the delegates have been dismissed by them claiming "new evidence
has come to light" and refusing to elaborate further, despite the fact that
Eaton runs the de facto intelligence agency of the Koncord. Before leaving,
Eaton says that he will support you and asks if he should prepare anything to
help with your efforts. You tell him that no specific actions are required at
this time.

With a final warning that he knows the location of the safe-house, you depart
and move to a room at the Lost Palm Tree, a run-down motel in a poorer part of
town. The news of the Forum's unanimous vote to outlaw you is shocking, but Meru
already has a meeting scheduled with Ikoma Sakome, one of the delegates from the
Niven Imperium to see a showing of Omelet by Wilfred Mountmore at a local
theater, the Icosahedron, which was arranged using [Sending](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Sending) by Jusa.

> From Meru: Important news regarding new Herske - conspiracy and LAKE, defaming
> us. Meet at Icosahedron for Omelet tonight to discuss future - empty hands, good
> faith.

To which Ikoma relies:

> I'll see what I can arrange.

The play itself is mediocre; a story about a dethroned prince seeking revenge on
his uncle for the murder of his father with all together too many egg
puns. Eventually Meru, with Gwen under his hat in the form of an insect, finds
Ikoma and sits next to her. The two exchange pleasantries and Meru offers their
condolences for the death of Ikoma's family. Just as they are moving onto the
main topic, Ambition, Meru falls asleep. While asleep, they dream of a figure in
black robes with deep blue runes embroider onto it. Dauntless. Who seemed
amused that Meru though they were a member of the government. They told Meru
that they has been sent to remove Meru from the equation, but that it would be
more challenging then normal due to Meru's resilient mind.

Meanwhile, Gwen has sprung into action, and at first attempted to get the
attention of Ikoma before realizing that she was in a mental state similar to
sleep-walking. Gwen then exchanged places with her familiar (to the confusion of
the audience members) to warn the rest of you about the danger. Transposing
back, Gwen disrupted the magical effect on Meru with [Dispel Magic, Greater](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Dispel%20Magic,%20Greater). This
shunned they back into their body just as Dauntless was casting a spell, the
effects of which unknown even to Meru's trained eye.

Meru and Gwen quickly retreated to the Lost Palm Tree to regroup with the rest
of the Task Force. Realizing the power that Ambition and LAKE holds over the
rest of the Forum, you resolved to act fast and make no further contact with
Delegates.

Finally, Meru explained that they believe Dauntless is an Eichen based on a
vision from their first trip to Kerkard, of a figure in the sky who was looking
back at Meru and clearly had a Eichen tail. Meru also realized that they knew
about Bur Harcosa's death before it happened. While processing this new
information, Zorro remembered that some Eichen have stronger shape-shifting
abilities then he does, but you aren't if or how that factors into what you know
about Dauntless.

We now resume on the 18th night of Whitermire, with you all gathered in a single
dreary motel room on the out-skirts of the city.
