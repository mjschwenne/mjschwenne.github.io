When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

The Task Force had just teleported to the Roksduens, the eastern edge of the
Basin and home of Redfern. Once you reached Tomo, the closest thing to a capital
of the Roksduens, you sought out Hibiscian Saffren, the elder of the Tomo tribe.

Upon entering the town hall, which also serves a number of other purposes
ranging from tavern, inn, courthouse and legislature, you were approached by a
young man a who told Redfern to cover his face and follow. He then lead you to
behind a curtain in the rear of the hall, where Elder Hibiscian Saffren sat. He
started by giving Redfern a warning; he had been outlawed upon leaving the Roks,
meaning that any crime could be committed against him and he was outside any aid
from the Roks.

He also assumed that your current appearance was about the devastating raid on
the Calchiroos Tribe over a week ago. He told you that judging from where the
black plumes of smoke were coming from, the raider band was moving south and
attacking every nomad caravan they encountered.

After the meeting, Redfern borrowed Wil's hat of disguise to remain unnoticed.
At the market, you tracked down a merchant selling and renting camels to see
about getting a guide for the desert journey ahead of you. The camel merchant
told you that most of the local guides aren't willing to approach such an
obvious threat as the raider band, but that a non-local wanderer who seemed
familiar with the desert came through recently and that she might be willing to
risk both the heat of the desert and the threat of the raiders. A brief search
later, you tracked down a drow druid named Guinevere in the tavern section of
the town hall. Oisin was certainly surprised to be face-to-face with a type of
elf which he had only heard of in myth and folklore. Guinevere did agree to
guide the group and you set off the next morning.

At of the end of two days trekking through the desert, you caught with the
raiding party just after they had attacked a small caravan and where starting to
load the supplies. With a frighteningly effective blitz tactic, you launched an
attack on the unwitting raiding party. Opening with a powerful [Firefall](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Firefall), Oisin
caused all but the leaders of the party to be blinded for five rounds. Given the
numbers disadvantage, this was a combat changing move that dramatically reduced
the number of active threats. Other highlights include:

-   The figure in armor nearly shattering Breagan's sword with a powerful [Sunder](https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Sunder&Category=Combat+Maneuvers).
-   An enlarged Wil dealing approximately eighty points of damage in a single turn.
-   Meru doing the wiggle to cause the enemy bloodrager to become shaken.
-   The figure in armor quickly being knocked unconscious thanks to the focus of
    Breagan and Wil.
-   The enemy bloodrager fleeing from the scene and sounding a retreat horn before
    being vaporized by a [Lightning Bolt](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Lightning%20Bolt) cast by Zorro.

While the leaders where slain or captured, many of the raiders fled into the
desert and where not apprehended.

We now resume late on the night of the 17th of Shimmerfall as you stand in the
charred remains of a small nomadic caravan. The figure in adamantine armor with
a vorpal sword has it unconscious but stable, bound and disarmed by Breagan, Wil
and Jusa. The rest of the task force is returning from the brief chase caused by
the fleeing bloodrager.
