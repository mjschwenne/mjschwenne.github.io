When we last ventured to the Great Basin,

The Task Force had learned that the Sword of Divinity was in a lab on
Kratermeer, the lake in the center of the Basin. Using his pervious
reconnaissance, Oisin was able to teleport you all to the Isle of Ruin by
temporarily placing Wil in his Bag of Holding. After a brief respite at the
Rusty Lightning Bolt (the only tavern on the island), during which Oisin cast
[Akashic Communion](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Akashic%20Communion). He asked to see:

1.  A member of LAKE entering the laboratory. He saw a circular room with a
    slightly raised dais in the center. Around the edges are numerous book
    shelves. The walls were a smooth white stone.
2.  The event of that building being built. He saw a pearly white tower
    stretching into the sky. The skyline was completely foreign to him, most
    similar to the capital of the Caerwent Empire which Oisin had seen while
    [Scrying](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Scrying). Standing in front of it was a elderly wizard in a purple velvet robe
    cutting a golden rope in front of the tower.
3.  A wizard of the Tower of Torrents re-discovering the Tower. He sees a short
    figure consistent with Daalvis enter the room from the stairs leading
    down. There were no maps taken or records make in the vision, only a few
    cryptic remarks about lefts and rights and twisting tunnels.

After Oisin's divination magic, you decided to search for entrances to the
underground ruins that pot-mark the surface of the island. You divide the island
and each member searches a quadrant. While Meru found a few entrances with
litter, Redfern found one further out with only a few mud slides leading down.

You descend into the maze of ruins. Zorro encounters a thunder rune after not
checking a door properly, and a bit later the rest of the Task Force found a
Blood Lily. This carnivorous plant sucks the blood out of its victims but was no
match for Wil's mighty fists. Later, after asking Jusa to use [Dungeonsight](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Dungeonsight) and
look for circular rooms, you encountered a small humanoid with transparent skin
in a circular chamber full of gold. The creature is not happy to see you, but
doesn't become violent. Finally, you later proceed into a chamber covered in
debris. In the middle of the room is a blob of violet goo.

We now resume as the goo slowly rises from the floor into a perfect sphere in
front of you.
