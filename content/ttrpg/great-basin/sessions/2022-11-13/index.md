When we last ventured to the Great Basin,

It was the 10th of Shimmerfall, 1763 and the annual Niven Lantern Festival,
which the members of the task force had been invited to using Zorro's
connections to the Krig Marchi Elenek and subsequently her personal friendship
with a forum delegate from the Imperium, Ikoma. After a conversation with the
owner of the Midnight Lotus, Takayama, the party believed that Niwa wanted them
steal Raifusutīrā, the life stealing katana. Their mission was further
complicated by realizing that Ikoma would be their chaperon for the night.

To start, the members asked for a tour of the Palace. While Ikoma didn't lead
you into a room titled "Super Powerful Artifact Storage", you did note several
staircases leading down, which is where Takayama mentioned the artifacts could
be found. After the tour, while enjoying some nice food, Zorro was the first to
enter the sparring rink with member of the Niven military. Unfortunately, he did
not feel comfortable wielding the Niven wooden katana and didn't advance out of
the first round. Later, however, Wil and Blue Eyes both advanced out of the
first round, using various class abilities to gain proficiency with weapon.

As the rest of the party, minus Breagan, foundered to create a plan, Wil and
Blue Eyes continued to advance in the tournament. Wil was eliminated by a
Daimyo, but Blue Eyes managed to defeat a Daimyo and advance to face the Emperor
of the Niven Imperium.

Meanwhile, Jusa was using her _Remote Viewing_ ability to probe the basement for
the location of an artifact vault. While the rest of the party was engaged with
the fight between Blue Eyes and the Emperor, Oisin, Zorro and Jusa slipped down
a staircase. Using _[Adjustable Disguise](https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Adjustable%20Disguise)_, Oisin disguised himself to look like
Ikoma and convinced the guards to let him pass. Once the vault had been located,
Oisin used _[Knock](https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Knock)_ to open the door to the vault. Inside the vault, you saw seven
artifacts, one on each side of an octagonal room.

1.  An average looking katana.
2.  A clockwork cube.
3.  A jawbone tied to a leather chord.
4.  A shard of silvery metal.
5.  A large iridescent gemstone.
6.  A rusty ring.
7.  A glass orb with a heavy bronze sheen.

Opening the glass compartment triggered a spring loaded dart which struck Oisin.
Fortunately some quick first aid prevented the poison on the dart from taking
affect. Inside the container was a holographic projector which hide the physical
katana from being displayed. While the room itself was a powerful anti-magic
field specialized to suppress artifact level items, so upon leaving Oisin slid
the weapon into his bag. When the group arrived back at the courtyard, the
corpse of a Daimyo lay next to the sparring ring. Naturally the palace was
locked down pending an investigation. After about an hour, the Adobaizā, a
special advisor to the Emperor and spiritual leader, called the task force and
Ikoma to a conference room in the Palace. She dismissed Ikoma quickly, despite
her protests, and then revealed herself to be Niwa, pulling what almost looked
like a mask off as she rose to full height. After confirming that they had the
item she needed, she simply stated that she still needed your help and pulled
out a bottom of gray liquid and smashed it, teleporting the task force into the
middle of the forest. When Niwa asked if you needed rest, you decided to push
forward.

After four hours of walking, we resume at a spirit gate where you have been
challenged by a suite of spiritual armor. It did not seem keen on letting you
pass, insisting that your quest was going to disrupt the flow of nature. It also
hinted to Breagan that the task force had been keeping her in the dark.
