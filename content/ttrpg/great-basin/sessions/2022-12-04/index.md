When we last ventured to the Great Basin,

It still the 10th of Shimmerfall. After successfully stealing the life-stealing
katana, Raifusutīrā, and meeting Niwa she used a bottle filled with gray liquid
to transport the Task Force and herself into a remote part of the Niven forest.
When asked if you would like to rest, you decided to push forward.

Eventually the party encountered a large gate marking the treeline on a trek up
a mountain. As you approached, the spectral form of a suite of armor
materialized and challenged you. It claimed that your reason for climbing the
mountain was to upset the balance of nature and "was not a just cause". After a
brief conversation which quickly stalled, Niwa signaled to Oisin that it was time
to take out the armor and pass by force.

The fight that ensued was not a typical combat. Because the you had elected not
to rest before climbing the mountain, the spellcasters were critically low on
spells and everybody was low on consumable class resources. The fighting was
tough, the spectral armor aided by two statues flanking the gate. Notable
moments in the fight included:

-   Redfern summoning a giant scorpion and it immediately getting killed by the armor.
-   Oisin creating the illusion of a solid rock wall filling the gate and creating
    a barrier to pass though.
-   Breagan refusing to fight, instead just maneuvering to the other side of
    the illusionary wall and waiting for the rest of the task force to cross through.

After the fight, everybody was eager to rest. Moving about an hour past the
gate, a suitable camp site was selected. During the first watch shift, a new
figure approached, accosting Wil with a simple and poignant "Hello Wil". They
were wearing a cloak of vibrant, glowing constellations over traditional Niven
gear and levitating a few inches above the ground. They also carried an empty
katana scabbard and a large farmer's hat. Introducing themselves as Meru, they
explained that they had seem the faces of the Task Force and this location
written in the stars and decided to come assist in their goal of upsetting the
leadership of the Keburipemi Syndicate. After some tense discussions with Niwa
and the rest of the Task Force, it was decided that Meru would join them for at
least this mission.

The next morning, with everybody rested, you set out again with a clearer idea
of your mission. Niwa had explained overnight that Keburipemi was chained in the
caldera of an active volcano which had a monastery designed to guard the
imprisoned god. She was unsure if the monastery had been compromised by the
sinister influence of Keburipemi, but even if it wasn't the monks would not
allow outsiders to see the deity so heavy resistance should be expected. During
this time, Breagan learned for the first time about the mission and while
everybody thought she was going to oppose it, she actually approved of slaying
one of the most evil and active deities in the Niven Imperium. We resume with
all of you assembled outside the massive, heavy brass doors of a large monastery
which is slightly recessed into the mountain.
