When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

The task force and their allies had stormed a remote monastery in the Niven
Imperium, set on the volcano containing Keburipemi, the Niven deity of smoke,
greed and misdirection who also was running the largest crime syndicate in the
Basin. Before you stood the three masked avatars of Keburipemi. They let you
quote "deliberate" for some time before asking the strength of your resolve and
if there was room to negotiate. They promised wealth and incredible boon in
exchange for allowing Keburipemi to live.

Their words fell on deaf ears, for you were united that Keburipemi must die.

The fight was swift and brutal. The avatars possessed powerful abilities
including extremely high displacement, gaze attacks and scream which chills you
to the bone, even in the extreme heat of the volcano. Soon thereafter,
Keburipemi himself rose from the lava as much as he come, exposing a single
eye. However, he was still able to unleash destruction across the battlefield.

Highlights of the battle include:

-   Meru using [Obscuring Mist](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Obscuring%20Mist) to block the effects of the Black Mask's gaze attack.
-   Wil knocking out the Red Mask with a single blow.
-   Redfern summoning a Cerberi.
-   The Red Mask's scream causing all but Breagan to flee in terror.
-   Keburipemi's gaze of hatred causing many members of the Task Force to
    temporarily attack each other.

And of course, the tag team between Zorro and Breagan which lead to the defeat
of a God. Zorro used [Floating Disk](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Floating%20Disk) to levitate Breagan, equipped with the
life-stealing katana Raifusutīrā, to within striking range of Keburipemi.

The traditional slashing strikes proved unable to find purchase on the thick
hide of the elder dragon until Breagan finally hefted the sword above her head
and slammed it down in a stabbing motion. The dragon strained against the pull
of the sword, but his body turned to smoke and was sucked in regardless. Saved
only by the floating disk, Breagan quickly retreated to the shore of the lava
lake just as the lava itself realized that the dragon was gone and collapsed
inward on itself, spraying you all. It was this final splash of lava which did
Redfern in, the rest of you carrying his body out of the volcano.

A safe distance from the monastery, you stopped for a break and Niwa demanded
the sword immediately. Breagan was hesitant, but eventually yielded the sword to
avert further bloodshed. While now clearly wary of you, Niwa recognized the
great debt that she owns you and teleported you back to Daitoshi. She also had a
mage resurrect Oisin and Redfern.

We now resume in the safehouse Niwa led you to in, just after your two dead
members are restored to life. The safehouse is a cramped space tucked just
beneath a larger wholesale shop. While many other operatives seem to be coming
and going, to the street and to chambers deeper in the network, you are in a
small room thus far undisturbed by the rush of activity...
