When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

It was the morning of Whitermire 8th, the day of the Herske Election. While Meru
and Wil headed over to the Forum to monitor the results of the election, Oisin,
Redfern and Zorro went to visit Ferdinand Banciu, a prominent collector who
recently had his son disappear along with the Pendant of Izuka, one of the few
known Herald artifacts.

Ferdinand tole you his account of the night his son and the pendant disappeared,
about a cruise on the Serene Squall since it was his wedding anniversary and
then coming home to find a pool of blood in the drawing room. He also detailed
his security system, which was impressive.

-   All of the doors and windows have masterwork locks with [Arcane Lock](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Arcane%20Lock) cast on
    them.
-   The whole house is under a constant [Invisibility Purge](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Invisibility%20Purge).
-   Several glass statues in the house are actually Glass Golems who activate if
    any of the display pieces are touched without speaking a password first.
-   Living paintings, which constantly monitor the room the pendant was displayed
    in.
-   If any of the other systems are triggered, [Guards and Wards](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Guards%20and%20Wards) is automatically
    cast on the house.
-   All collection items are marked with [Arcane Mark](https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Arcane%20Mark).

And yet even with all of this security, somebody was able to gain entry to the
house and take the pendant without leaving any trace of themselves. Oisin took
one of Samuel Banciu's hairs to potential scry on him or disguise himself as
Sam.

Meanwhile, the election results are it! Of the four candidates running, nobody
received a majority of the votes so a run-off election will be held in two day's
time between the top two candidates, Barno Henchor from the Eichen Kingdom and
Vessimur Yutros from the Principality of Vi. The rest of the elections results
are below.

After that eventful morning, you decided to ask your daily allotment of
questions to the stars and determined that the primary thief of the Sword of
Divinity is in Sino, a medium-sized city in Trobreryn which is home to the
Mages' Guild headquarters. Looking to get there _fast_, before the thief has a
chance to leave town, you decided to sky-dive off of Kerkrad that night,
relaying on Meru to be the beacon on the ground and Oisin to cast [Feather Fall](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Feather%20Fall)
to safely deliver everybody to the ground. Fortunately, everything goes as
planned and you land 3 miles from Ravencross, a small town in the Trobreryn
country-side. Resting here for the night, you get set off in the morning to get
to Sino using a combination of [Overland Flight](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Overland%20Flight) and [Teleport](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Teleport) to get everybody
there by dinner time on Whitermire 9th.

You check into The Gray Owlbear Hotel and Meru gets to work talking to the
numerous people in the lobby. They learn that there is a yearly submit of mages
and administrators taking place in Sino right now. The most contentious issue
seems to be about how student mages are allocated to the academies and towers
within Trobreryn. The Tower of Torrents, arguably the most prestigious mage
school in the Basin is claiming that they should have guaranteed access to
students in Trobreryn since they are technically within Trobreryn. However, they
don't have the capacity to meet the requirement of all of the other Trobreryn
academies since they also accept numerous applicants from outside of Trobreryn,
effectiving trying to drain the top talent out of the Trobreryn Arcane Academy
and it's affiliated campuses.

We now resume late on the night of the 9th as you all gather around the star
chart to ask the daily questions...
