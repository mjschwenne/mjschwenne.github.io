When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

The Task Force had just returned to Kerkard from the Roksduens there they had
defeated a solider of the Caerwent Empire and reclaimed some valuable adamantine
arms and armor. Almost immediately upon returning to the city above, Wil paid
Oisin to make him a Large (with a capital 'L') lad permanently. The recovery of
the adamantine armaments proved especially useful to Breagan, who realized that
she could use these pieces to gain entry to the Lato, the personal guards of the
King of Galimatias, Bennett James.

Midday on Shimmerfall 21st, Breagan formally joined the Lato in a ceremony
presided over by the King, Queen, Prince and the rest of the Lato. After which
there was a mighty feast full of excellent food and fine sprits (as in alcohol,
NOT undead which would be near-instantly destroyed with extreme prejudice in
Galimatias). Breagan's new duties would require her to stay in Galimatias on a
near full-time basis and she will not be able to participate in daily Task Force
activities.

After the feast, the rest of you returned to Kerkard in an at least slightly
intoxicated state to sleep it off. The next morning, during breakfast, Oisin
suddenly realized that his pants were on backwards and dropped trow at the
tavern to fix this. Also, you got a letter from The Forum stating that one week
from today, you will appear before them to deliver a progress report on your
investigation.

We now resume on the 22nd of Shimmerfall just your casual breakfast was
interrupted by the news of a Forum appearence on the 28th of Shimmerfall.
