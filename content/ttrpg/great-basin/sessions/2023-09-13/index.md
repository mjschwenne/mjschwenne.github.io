When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

The members of the Task Force had just defeated Zealous, Nimble and Nefarious, a
group of LAKE members who had presumably been tasked with guarding the
Sword of Divinity. During that battle, both Oisin and Zorro were
slain and you were hopeful that their deaths would be rewarded with the
long-sought sword.

Those who remained turned their attention to the laboratory itself. Using [Detect
Magic](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Detect%20Magic), Meru found a large magic source under the center of the floor. Blue
Eyes gained a borrow speed and cleared the obsidian-encrusted floor while Gwen
cast [Create Treasure Map](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Create%20Treasure%20Map) using Nefarious' skin and that this lab is holding the
sword. Once the floor was cleared, Jusa used a [Divination](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Divination) to ask

> How could Meru safely retrieve the Sword of Divinity from its current place?

and learned

> Rotate the seal until the primary rune points home.

Looking at the intricate stone platform in the center of the lab, you quickly
identify the center rune as one of the most basic conjuration runes in the
arcane literature. After a quick debate, you decide to point the top of the rune
towards Ændor and when Gwen rotates the capstone into position and a black
liquid starts to rise out of the cracks in the stone. The liquid swells, and
then recedes, and reveals the Sword of Divinity.

Also during this time, Jusa messaged Daalvis Zidba with [Sending](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Sending), saying:

> From Friends of Oisin: Oisin is dead (maybe fixable). In lab under Isle of Ruin,
> Need evac ASAP. Help

to which Daalvis responses with

> Risk to alerting Fractal and LAKE too great. Suspicion is high already. The
> Forum is compromised. Oisin will rise again. Long live Ændor.

Now you were faced with task of moving a sword known for burning those who touch
it in a column of holy-fire. The first of you to take the risk was Redfern,
using a [Mage Hand](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Mage%20Hand) to touch the Sword. Once he did, he ███ █ ██████ ██ ███████

███ █████ ██ ████████ ███ ████ ██ ███ █████████ ████ ██ ███ ███████ gave the

██████ ████ ██████ ███████ ███ █████████ ██ ████████████ ██████ ███████████ ███
████████ ████ █████████ █████████████ put the sword in their bag of holding.

You then left the lab and decided to kill the Kelpie to take their massive pile
of gold. It was easy when Meru successfully cast [Color Spray](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Color%20Spray), then Wil Coup de
Grace'd it. Your income totaled 150,000 gp and a helm with unknown magical
properties. You finally rose to the surface of the Isle of Ruin and made camp
for the night, planning to revive Oisin who can then teleport everybody off the
island without risking exposure to any potential LAKE spies. During the night,
Jusa prepared her spells and used [Raise Dead](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Raise%20Dead) and [Restoration](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Restoration) to bring him back
with one negative level. She repeated the process with Zorro's body.

Oisin was excited to learn that the rest of the group had recovered the sword
and asked to see it. Meru drew the Sword of Divinity from their bag and the
ethereal outline of six angel wings appear. Oisin asked to hold the sword and ██

█████ ████ ████ ██ █████ ██████ ████ ███ ██ ██ █████ erupts into a column of
holy fire, leaving nothing behind.

We now resume in your damp campsite as you look on in shock at the scored earth
were Oisin was just standing.
