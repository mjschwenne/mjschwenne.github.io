When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

The members of the Task Force had just encountered a spherical ooze raising from
a room full of debris and bone, a skeletal figure in the center of the ooze. You
had tried to just go around the ooze since it wasn't immediately hostile, but
when you did the eyes of the skeletal wizard flared to life and it cast [Chain
Lightning](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Chain%20Lightning) at you. At the same time, a stone statue of a head in the far corner
started to murmur a captivating tune which enchanted several of you. You quickly
decided the best course of action was to not waste resources and attempt to move
past the pair of monsters into the next chamber over. Eventually that was
accomplished and a [Wall of Stone](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wall%20of%20Stone) erected to seal the open doorway, blocking the
murmurs from following you. After proceeding through a few more mostly empty
chambers, you arrive a a locked stone door. Without any of the Task Force
members being particularly skilled at picking locks, Wil bashes the door down
with a tremendous racket. Beyond that door is your target, a circular room
exactly matching the size of the room in Oisin's vision, with stairs leading
upwards. You take the stairs into a damp but otherwise dry and clean space
filled with bookshelves and a low stone platform.

While you had expected the lab to be empty, with Daalvis Zidba and his aid still
away for the Mage's Guild Conference in Sino, you are instead greeted be a tall
woman with feathers growing in her hair and a large snake tail that ends with
more feathers. You ask were the Sword of Divinity is and she says that she
doesn't know. While skeptical of the answer, a few Sense Motive checks reveal
that she really doesn't know. Oisin is first to realize that a combat is brewing
and casts [Detect Thoughts](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Detect%20Thoughts) to learn more about the woman standing before you and
see if there are any other's hiding in the room. He learns that there are at
least two more people in the range of Detect Thoughts. When the combat starts,
several things happen all at once. Oisin casts [Obsidian Flow](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Obsidian%20Flow), Meru casts [Rainbow
Pattern](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Rainbow%20Pattern) and a gunshot echos through the small lab. Oisin has been hit with a
[Disintegrate](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Disintegrate) bullet and crumbs away into dust.

We now resume as the rest of you engage your foes in the hidden research lab.
