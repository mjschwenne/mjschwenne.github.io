When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

The members of the Task Force were battling with several members of the League
Against Koncord Eminence, namely Zealous and Nimble. Zealous proved to be a
particularly difficult foe, highly resistant to magic and a melee brute. The
arcs of her scythe capable of cleaving through multiple foes and critical blows
that can eviscerate any of you in one hit. Naturally, the strategy to fight
Zealous became to surround her with numerous summons from Redfern such as
Bearded Devils and Squids. Combined with a few consecutive Channel Energy's from
Jusa and the effectiveness of the cleaves was greatly reduced. However, Zealous
is not one to continue using an ineffective strategy and switched to targeting
all of her damage into one target, killing them before moving to the next
one. Since Zorro had charged up a [Shocking Grasp](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shocking%20Grasp) and dealt 100 points of damage
in his first turn engaged with Zealous, he was the first target and could not
withstand the onslaught of scythe strokes, falling dead to the stone floor of
the tower. While Zorro wasn't able to soak the damage from Zealous, Gwen,
through several uses of Wild Shapes (Which now that I read the ability text, I
don't actually think works in the way that the ability was used during the
fight) into a Mastodon.

While Zorro, Gwen and the summons where working on Zealous, Wil and Meru
tag-teamed Nefarious, the sniper hiding in the window who killed Oisin. Wil
pulled him out of the window and then Meru stunned him with a [Color Spray](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Color%20Spray),
grabbed his gun and ran. After that the strategy was simple; Wil punched and
kicked him until he went down.

Meanwhile, Nimble had been fascinated behind a bookshelf by Meru, but once Meru
lost concentration on the spell, he was able to recover and free himself from
the [Obsidian Flow](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Obsidian%20Flow) that Oisin cast before his death. Afterwards his climbed onto
the bookshelf to get a better view of the battlefield. In response, Redfern sent
some of the summons over to harass Nimble and absorb more damage. With his view
also blocked by the aforementioned mastodon, Gwen took quite a few shots from
Nimble as well, including one which put her under the effects of [Isolate](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Isolate). Nimble
realized that repeatidly killing summons from Redfern wasn't productive and
moved in on the rest of the party along the Southern side of the tower. But when
he did, Wil engaged him and he finally fell as well.

We now resume in the secret laboratory where Daalvis Zidba is researching the
Sword of Divinity, although the damage of the battle is clearly visible with
dead bodies on the floor, bullet holes everywhere and much of the lab floor
encased in sharp obsidian.
