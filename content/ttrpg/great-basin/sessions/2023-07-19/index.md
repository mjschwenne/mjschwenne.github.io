When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

The race was on to find Oisin after he took the news that Daalvis Zidba was the
thief of the Sword of Divinity that you were chasing. After Gwen's familiar
spotted Oisin entering the Trobreryn Arcane Academy, she switched places with it
in order to catch up to Oisin. When she went to talk to him in the entrance, he
wasn't interested in hearing what she had to say and cast [Icy Prison](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Icy%20Prison) on
her. Soon the rest of the Task Force with flight abilities, Meru and Zorro,
arrived. After each unsuccessfully attempted to dispel the block of ice, Meru
pressed forward to find Oisin while Zorro freed Gwen from the ice with a few
well-placed sword strikes.

Soon you had all gathered outside the large lecture hall were the Mages' Guild
Summit was taking place. The hallway was empty, so while Gwen attempted to track
Oisin (no small feat given the hard stone floor), Meru opened the door and
interrupted the proceedings taking place inside. This certainly garnered some
amount of ill-will from the mages, but quickly revealed that Daalvis and Oisin
where not in the lecture hall. Meanwhile, with the aid of a [Tracking Mark](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Tracking%20Mark) Gwen
was able to pick out Oisin's tracks. They lead up another flight of stairs and
to a nearby classroom. As you gathered outside the room, presumably ready to
burst in, Oisin opened the door.

Faced with a clearly angry group, Oisin raised his hands in an attempt to talk
everybody down. He said that Daalvis had admitted to being involved with the
thief of the sword, but also feared for his life as a member of an organization
which had been twisted by new leadership. Eventually you moved into an adjacent
classroom and discussed what could be done with this new information. Purposed
plans included:

1.  Luring Daalvis Zidba, his aid (whom Oisin stated was a true believer of the
    current LAKE leadership) and the sword to some remote location where they
    could be kill the aid and seize the sword.
2.  Storming the Isle of Ruin, where the sword is being kept, and having Daalvis
    help them gain access and betray the rest of LAKE once they arrived.
3.  Having Oisin attempt to infiltrate the Tower of Torrents solo. This one was
    not overly popular with the rest of the group.

Ultimately, no concrete decision was made, although plan 2 was the leading
contender. Either way, it became clear that you would need a way to safely get
to and from the Isle of Ruin. Oisin decided to solve this one by [Scrying](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Scrying) on
Headmaster Altair Aquila and then [Teleport](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Teleport) to the small village on the Isle of
Ruin which exists to support the Mage School. He was successful, earning you and
way on and off the island. Meanwhile, Gwen returned to Kerkrad via wild shape
and learned that Vessimur Yutros had won the Herske Election. The other
important news topic from the person that she talked too was something about the
destruction of the largest grain warehouse in Arendelle, which has the
potential to exacerbate a nascent food shortage. Oisin also glimpsed Daalvis'
aid, an extremely young boy dressed in blue.

We now resume early on Shimmerfall 12th as you awake in your rooms in the Grey
Owlbear.
