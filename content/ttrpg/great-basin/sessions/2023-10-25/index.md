When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

It was last at night on the 18th of Whitermire. The members of the Task Force
where holed up at the Lost Palm Tree, a dingy motel towards the outskirts of
Kerkard after a scary encounter that Meru and Gwen had with Dauntless. You
realized that without immediate action, the members of LAKE would just try to
pick you off one by one until you were too weak and paranoid to resist them.

You decided that information was the most important this to gather, and thanks
to Meru and Jusa, something you could do without having to leave the motel room.

Jusa cast [Divination](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Divination) twice, the first time asking

> Where will Ambition be tomorrow morning?

and receiving the answer

> Atop the hill in the halls of governance.

which you interpreted as the Central Forum or the Delegate tower for the
Principality of Vi.

Concerned about Dauntless, a powerful foe capable of manipulating your memories
and perceptions, she also asked

> Where will Dauntless be tomorrow morning at dawn?

and learned

> Returning from the field of dreams.

This one was distinctly less help, as you interpreted it as basically that
Dauntless would be waking up for the day.

Regardless, you pressed onward with Meru's daily questions, learning among other
things that Clayton Willock, the new Delegate from the Principality of Vi is a
member of LAKE. You also learned that

-   Daalvis Zidba, a.k.a. Freedom does not play to betray you if you attack
    Ambition.
-   That Ambition was ready but not waiting for your next move.
-   That Vessimur's staffers are not aware of his membership in LAKE.
-   That Vessimur will be sleeping in the Delegate tower for the Principality of
    Vi tonight and should still be there around dawn.

Putting all of these bits of information together, the unthinkable happened:
everybody agreed with Zorro. It was time to use the barrel of Cylex recovered
from the Taerwyn Dock Explosion oh so long ago. You decided to strike at dawn,
when Vessimur is likely to just be getting up for the morning and other staff
are the most likely to be away from the tower. Using Blue Eyes to place and
detonate the explosive, you plotted a bombing of the Forum not unlike the one
that started this whole adventure. Zorro separates the Cylex in half, creating
two 15 pound charges.

We now resume as you approach the Central Forum complex. Blue Eyes has just
taken flight to place the bomb outside Ambition's bedroom window. You're located
just outside the patrol lines around the building, preparing for the fight of
your life.
