When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

The members of the Task Force had just captured Vicious. After stripping him of
his weapons, he was imprisoned in one if his own jail cells. While unconscious,
you inventoried the Sanguine Ravager and the store rooms on the island. During
this time you also talked to the fish minions, who turned out to be dull
intellectually and took next to no convincing to keep them fixing their huts
while Oisin had burned. Also during this time, Oisin, Meru and Gwen ventured
under the lake to find the Kraken. After about an hour of searching the cramped
passageways under the island, you found the kraken in a larger cavern. It
introduced itself as Qwoshokk, the Consuming Tide and while it wasn't
interested in letting you build a tower on the island without swearing an oath
of fealty, it seemed to be rather agnostic towards Vicious now that he had been
defeated.

When Vicious awoke, he was willing to talk on one condition: his life.
Unfortunately for him, that wasn't something that you were interested in
sparing. While one group was under the waves, Vicious told you about his early
life. He started out as a deck hand for Ragnory Shipping Co and rose the ranks
until he was the first mate of the _Brilliant Jewel_. But he found it boring and
resigned to hunt kraken and sea serpents. Here he encountered Qwoshokk and spent
years hunting the mighty beast. Eventually, while at Qwoshokk's mercy, he
accepted a pact to serve the kraken in him mission to destroy the surface world.
As captain of the Sanguine Ravager, he become a feared pirate and mounted a raid
on the _Brillant Jewel_, his old ship. There he fought somebody, whom he would not
really identify, who killed his crew and offered to spare his live in exchange
for joining a different organization, LAKE. He stopped here since he did not
have the assurance of leaving the cell alive. Instead, with the clean message to
leave from Qwoshokk, you took him back to Kerkard to present him to the Forum.

Upon reaching the Forum, late on the 6th of Whitremire, you gathered the Forum
and noticed that one member, Bur Harcosa was missing. Turns out that he recently
died on the day that you set sail from Taerwyn. Operating without the Herske,
Marchi Elenek ran the meeting and everybody seemed happy and satisfied with
your progress this time. Specious of Bur's death, Meru asked the stars for
guidance and learned that his death was hastened by outside forces, that
somebody on the Forum knew this but had not ordered it and that that person was
within two city blocks of the Forum building.

We know resume in the working room of the Forum as Meru reports their findings
to the rest of you.
