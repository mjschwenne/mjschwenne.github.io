When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

The Task Force was recovering from slaying Keburipemi with Niwa in a syndicate
safe-house in Daitoshi, the Niven capital. Niwa explained that her sources told
her that the Daimyos of the Imperium where frustrated that they had not been
able to find you all for questioning after a homicide was committed during the
Lantern Festival. Despite this, one of their own and a representative to the
Koncord, Daimyo Ikoma, claimed to have seen Adobaizā Aoi lead you into a
conference room before dismissing her against her protests. In reality, it was
Niwa disguised as the Adobaizā. The Niven government wants to keep a closer eye
on you, which is difficult considering the amount of borders you regularly
cross. Their solution is to appoint a member to the Task Force directly who will
be able to report anything suspicious back to them. Niwa also explained that she
does not have the political power to select who the new member would be, but
does have enough to nominate somebody for consideration.

After a brief debate, you decided that Meru should be nominated for the
position. Niwa also mentioned that if you need to get in contact with her in the
future, visit Rokkaku's Ramen on Kerkrad and order the Rattlesnake Ramen.

Went the Task Force tried to teleport back to Kerkard, you were detained
momentarily by Niven Castle Guards and talked to both the Koncord
representatives and the Adobaizā, who was confused by your story of her
teleporting you all into the middle of the wilderness. However, she admitted
that the current political situation in the Basin meant that she could not
detain you without drawing the ire of the rest of the nations.

The next day, Meru was 'sworn in' as the official Niven representative on the
Task Force. While showing them to the workspace you had been appointed, the
Truthspeaker Steven was delivering the news. He told you that

1.  Arendelle had only harvested 76% of their expected yield and were
    investigating the cause and what can be done about it.
2.  The Kerkard Union of Dock Workers was disavowing a spike in sabotage occuring
    at the docks.
3.  A manhunt was still ongoing on Kerkard after the disappearance of the Pendant
    of Izuka (a powerful relic from the Heralds) and Samuel Banciu, son of
    collector Ferdinand Banciu. The Bastion of the Sky has not commented on
    whether they thing Samuel stole the pendant but are "considering all
    possibilities".
4.  In the Empire of Xylte, the son of an Imperial Senator was found dead in what
    is believed to be 13th murder by a pro-Andorr assassin. This one is notable
    because it was the first non-military target.
5.  Several days ago, in Roksduens, a massive raiding party wiped out Calchiroos
    Tribe by razing their central city. Preliminary reports mentioned a figure
    wearing refined metal armor and with a sword and shield, the first time such
    a figure has been reported with a raiding party. The shield had a hammer and
    laurels engraved on it.

Later, during several days of crafting and downtime, you also learned that

-   After news of the destruction in Roksduens, the Eichen Kingdom has announced
    that it will increase the upper age limit for conscription into it's armed
    forces to 30 and plans to grow the total number of active duty soldiers by
    50,000 across all divisions of its armed forces.
-   The Empire of Xylte will be imposing a curfew in all major cities from 10p -
    6a in response to the "threats from abroad and within" which will allow their
    guard to prepare to defense the glory of the Empire.
-   Sources in the Niven Imperium are reporting a massive increase in the number
    of gang fights and infighting within the Keburipemi Syndicate over the last
    few days. Rumors are that the leadership was recently overthrown, but there
    are no clues as to who the new leaders are.

On the 15th of Shimmerfall and the Task Force set out for Tomo, the 'capital'
(if you could call it that) of the Tomo tribe of Roksduens and the nation as a
whole. You teleported to a circle in the middle of a henge, no civilization in
site except a dirt path. Following the path across a mostly barren scrubland for
several hours lead to a medium sized town composed primarily of ramshackle wooden
huts and tents. The settlement looked like it was originally a nomadic group
that simply stopped moving many years ago.

We now resume in the town square, when an eidolon duel between a horse-like
creature with many horns fights a large bear-creature with multicolored fur. A
large crowd has gathered to watch.
