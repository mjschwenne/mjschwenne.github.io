When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

The members of the task force had just arrived in Sino, a medium-sized city home
to the Trobreryn Mages' Guild and the Trobreryn Arcane Academy. After checking
into the Grey Owlbear Hotel, Meru consults their star chart and surprisingly
learns that the Thief has left the city but is still in Trobreryn. The next day,
continuing to use Meru's star chart, you learn that the Thief is currently
teleporting between destinations on a cyclic pattern and will return to Sino
within the week. Otherwise, not much happens as Oisin and Meru canvas the town
for landmarks and rumors. You hear that recently, a student killed a professor
in a graduation duel, despite a powerful artifact that prevents a lethal
damage.

The next day, you decide to do something other than gaze at the star
chart. Oisin and Meru travel to the Academy to ask some questions to the Guild
Master Tarja Petr, particularly about if unusual teleportation signatures were
appearing in the city. Tarja was happy to chat with Meru, but Oisin was
recognized by a familiar face on his way into the meeting hall, Daalvis Zidba,
the Dean of Students at the Tower of Torrents. Oisin ate lunch with Daalvis
while Meru talked to Tarja and learned that Daalvis was teleporting back and
forth from the Tower daily to keep the Headmaster Altair Aquila informed about
the progress being made towards resolving the alotment issue between the Tower
and the Academy. Basically, the Tower of Torrents was claiming that since they
are within Trobreryn's borders they were entitled to pull from the pool of
Trobreryn students. However, they don't have the facilities to teach non-arcane
mages such as divine or primal casters. According to Tarja, Daalvis literally
wrote the book on teleportation magic and was the only guild member returning
home every night.

After learning this, Meru consulted his star chart and confirmed that Daalvis
was the Thief of the Sword of Divinity that you had been hunting. On the way
back from the Academy, Meru told Oisin who did not take the news lightly. Oisin
stormed off while Meru returned to the hotel. Meru gathered the rest of you and
explained what happened. Gwen sent her familiar to search for Oisin and spotted
him entering the Academy again. She then swapped places with the hawk to try to
intercept Oisin. Once that happened, everybody else started to race towards the
Academy.

We now resume as everybody races to find Oisin, Gwen in the entryway of the
Academy and the rest of the Task Force departing from the hotel room.
