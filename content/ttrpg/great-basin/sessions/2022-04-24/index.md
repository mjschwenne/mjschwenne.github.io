When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

It was Fireharvest 22nd and the members of the task force were engaged
in a operation with the Taerwyn city guard against the Keburipemi
Syndicate after receiving some intelligence from an operative within the
Syndicate, Niwa, as assassin looking to humiliate Vicious in front of
the upper leadership of the syndicate. Aided by Nessa Preston, a battle
mage and several city guards, a hard fought battle ensued. Highlights
include: - Oisin greasing Vicious's sword, making it difficult for him
to grasp it. - An enlarged Breagan making multiple critical hits against
Voracious. - Redfern, Breagan and Wil all coming very close to death. -
The capture of Voracious. - Oisin flying underwater to see where Vicious
swam to as he was retreating, which worked until Vicious hid in a kelp
forest and Oisin lost track of him. After the operation, the task force
became level 6 and received a total of 37,800 gp, or 5,400 per person.
