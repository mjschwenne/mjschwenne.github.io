When we last ventured to the Great Basin...

It was the 28th of Shimmerfall. After dodging numerous questions from the Forum
and defeating a resolution to severely limit access to Koncord resources, you
prepared to hunt Vicious, the only known member of the League Against Koncord
Eminence and the slayer of Wil's father Foalan Ragnory.

Using the knowledge from Niwa's messenger, you knew that Vicious was on an
island in Kratermeer. This island was supposedly enshrouded in mist and had the
tendency to move around the big lake. You visited Taerwyn again so that Wil
might attend his father's funeral and so that you could charter a ship from
Ragnory Shipping Co for the hunt. In negotiations with the dock master, it was
agreed upon that they would charge the Koncord 3,000 gp for a voyage to an
unknown location which would take an unknown number of days.

On the 33th of Shimmerfall, you left Taerwyn. After four days on the lake, and
several major course corrections which backed the claim that the island itself
moves, you awoke in a void of fog. Near the end of the day, the bow of your ship
landed on a beach of gravel. Quickly scouting while the crew of the ship stayed
behind, you located a massive cave, one large enough to hold a warship. So
perfectly warship sized... that it _was_ housing a warship! Gwen used [Spider
Climb, Communal](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Spider%20Climb,%20Communal) to move the party across the ceiling, avoiding a cluster of
huts and humanoids with bulbous eyes, sparse hair and webbed fingers.

You deduced that Vicious was in the captain's quarters and plotted an assault
from the ceiling. Descending from the mast of the Sanguine Ravager you stormed
the cabin! Luck was with you, or perhaps more accurately luck with was Gwen.
While Meru struggled to get a successful [Color Spary](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Color%20Spray) or [Debilitating Portent](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Debilitating%20Portent),
and Wil and Zorro absorbed massive amounts of damage, she was able to cast [Pox
Pustuals](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Pox%20Pustules) and [Slowing Mud](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Slowing%20Mud) on Vicious _as well as_ [Pup Shape](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Pup%20Shape) a kraken which was
harassing Redfern's summons from over the edge of the ship.

Eventually, Vicious fell unconscious and the fish-like people entangled
themselves in a [Web](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Web) created by Oisin.

We now resume on the 4th of Shimmerfall, with an apprehended Vicious, entangled
minions and a baby kraken somewhere in the depths.
