The information in this document in expected to be given to the GM by
Monday, January 10th, 2022.

We all agreed to devote some time this winter break so that the campaign
would be successful. I am simply asking everybody to fulfill this
agreement.

So what is the bare minimum level of information that I expect from each
of you? It can be divided into two categories


## Character Backstory {#character-backstory}

This information includes:

-   Character Name
-   Character Pronouns
-   Character Species
-   Character Class

As well is some more personal information.

Specifically, a one paragraph description of your characters role and
it's duties within your government.

A character summary (see the info box below for more details) of your
character's direct supervisor / boss within their government, at least
one friend or ally and at least one rival or enemy.

A description of the relationship between your character and their
family.

_This last one is very important, think carefully about it._ A strong
ambition for your character. What drives them to adventure or enter the
political fray that this international politics. Do they need access to
something only available to members of the government or the ability to
travel with some level of privilege, do they think they could raise to
the top and one day rule their people?


## Government Information {#government-information}

When a ''Character Summary'' is asked for, the expected information
is:

-   Name
-   Pronouns
-   Two sentence description

The following important people need character summaries.

-   The **two representatives** sent from your government to the Forum of the Koncord
-   The formal **head of state**, such as a King, Queen, Baroness, etc
-   The **internal decision maker**, such as a Prime Minister. In many governments
    this may be the same as the head of state.
-   One other **important NPC** holding some type of advisor or otherwise important
    position within the government. This could be a court mage, religious leader
    or personal confidant to the head of state.

A one paragraph description of how decisions are made within the government. Do
laws need to be passed by a legislature? If one person like a king is in charge,
well they probably cannot personally oversee every decision in the government,
so what does their support structure look like?

Some description of the military, if it exists.

Two guiding principles or doctrines of the government.

A one paragraph description of any historically significant event, such as a the
founding of the modern variant of the government (if they have been majorly
reformed, or collapsed, etc) or maybe how they were originally
founded. Something important, maybe the capital city was destroyed at some point
or a historic figure (in the government or not) was killed under suspicious
circumstances.

**I encourage you all to go above and beyond this minimal requirement**
