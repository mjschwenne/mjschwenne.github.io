## The Koncord's Tenants of Spellcasting {#the-koncord-s-tenants-of-spellcasting}

Mechanically speaking for the game, these restrictions mean that the Koncord will
not fund or allow research into many high level enchantment or divination
spells, as well as spells or items designed to cause mass destruction or commit
crimes against sentient life.

Mages caught researching these topics or using magic of this nature anywhere in
the Great Basin are to be arrested and tried for their crimes by a high court in
the country of offense. Punishment ranges, but generally starts at life in
prison for any spellcaster who willingly use such spells or conducted research
into these areas.

While the Koncord attempts to limit access to all of these spells, much of the
time high level mages have the tools required to hide themselves from the
authorities. As such, illicit spellbooks can be found all around the Great Basin
if you ask the right question to the right person.
