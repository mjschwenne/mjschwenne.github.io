## The Shattering {#the-shattering}

Nearly 1,800 years ago, a new star appeared in the sky over a land we know
frighteningly little about. What we do know is that all of the oracles, augurs
and sibyls of this land started receiving constant visions of death and calamity
on a scale that they'd never seen. Years pasted, and the star grew brighter and
brighter in the night sky, now called Xylte, Destroyer of Worlds promised doom
to all that lived below.

A band of heroes then rose with a plan to save the land from certain
destruction.

-   Kieros, Herald of Divinity
-   Gralf, Herald of Courage
-   Azeem, Herald of Foresight
-   Izuka, Herald of Knowledge
-   Rimev, Herald of Happiness
-   Xul, Herald of Stealth

It was only through their work that civilization survived the impact of Xylte,
an event now known as the Shattering. While we don't know how they did it, what
we do know is that afterwards the heart of the Star of Death was suspended over
a newly formed basin.

These events occurred 1763 years ago. For the next several hundred years,
records are incomplete and little is known.


## The Basin Today {#the-basin-today}

The Great Basin as it has become is currently divided into ten kingdoms with a
boundary ring of mountains and large lake in the center, Kratermeer.

### Atreides Duchy {#atreides-duchy}

> Yep. This is shamelessly stolen from _Dune_. To be fair, I picked that specific
> book before I realized how many of you have read the book. The largest
> difference between the people in the book and the people here is that Paul was
> never born.

The Atreides Duchy is located in the northwest of the Great Basin, directly
above the Principality of Vi. The government of the Duchy is centered around the
Duke and Duchess, currently Leto and Jessica Atreides. There capital city of
Caladan is not opulent like some other capital cities, but it is very welcoming.
That describes the Atreides people well, not the wealthiest, but very generous
and sharing with others. They are one of the first to offer assistance to other
kingdoms and because of this are generally well liked by the other members of
the Koncord.


#### Government Structure {#government-structure}

The title of Duke is hereditary, pasted from parents to the eldest child through
the generations. The Duke and Duchess serve as the executive seat of power,
directing the military and negotiating with the other kingdoms. Laws are
enforced by the Duke and Duchess but passed by the Landsraad, a legislature
consisting of representatives from towns and cities of the Duchy with a set
number of representatives per population bracket. Individual cities are able to
pick representative however they feel.


#### Locations {#locations}

-   **Capital City**: Caladan
-   **Secondary Cities:**
    -   Acadia
    -   Bellfort


#### People {#people}

-   **Four Important Figures:**
    -   Duke Leto Atreides
    -   Duchess Jessica Atreides
    -   Master at Arms Gurney Halleck
        -   Leader of the military forces of the Duchy. While these forces are small,
            Halleck is an well known and respected warrior and likewise the quality of
            the Atreides infantry is very high.
    -   Mentat Thufir Hawat
        -   The Mentat title is a very important one within the Atreides Duchy,
            reversed for a trusted advisor with a truly formidable breadth of
            knowledge. Hawat uses a spacial meditative state to strength his mental
            abilities.

    -   Katherine
-   **Naming Guidelines:** British English


### Commune of Atrxous {#commune-of-atrxous}

Most of the other governments have centralized power structure, but not the
Commune of Atrxous. This government is communism, enforced via a magic contract
called The Atrxous. Once you sign the contract, you agree to share all of your
wealth, shed your social status and live for the betterment of the Commune.
Violating the contract is impossible, enforced via enchantment magic and the
transmutation of the valuable to the worthless.


#### Government Structure {#government-structure}

Formally speaking, there is no structure to the government since there is
effectively no government. Generally there is no need for one either since the
Atrxous prevents crimes from being committed against others who have signed it.


#### Locations {#locations}

-   **Capital City:** (If they formally had one) Atrxous - Hardly more than a hamlet,
    Atrxous holds the contract in the only fully stone building in the Commune


#### People {#people}

-   **Important NPCs:**
    -   Forum Delegate Brigita Červinkov
    -   Forum Delegate Leopold Kadlec
-   **4 Common Names:**
    -   Ludvik
    -   Kristian
    -   Saskie
    -   Dagmar
-   **Language of Inspiration:** Longer names, often with harsh consonant sounds.
    Similar to Czech.


### Eichen Kingdom {#eichen-kingdom}

> **Editor's Note:** Ah, yes, how can anybody forget the fascist, German squirrels?

The land of the Eichen is the land of their forests. Populated nearly exclusively
by shape-changing anthropomorphic squirrels (A re-flavored kitsune), the Eichen
Kingdom is a militarist place with a... strong sense of community. There is also
a strong worship of Grosse Eichornchen, the squirrel god.


#### Government Structure {#government-structure}

Unlike most monarchies where the title is passed down by blood, the title of
King or Queen in the Eichen Kingdom is determined by a series of challenges
including sparring (unarmed and armed), survival tests and quizzes about the
history of the Kingdom and military tactics. After the challenges, the populous
votes in a ranked-choice election.

Once elected, the monarch rules for life and near-complete control over all
aspects of Eichen government, military and economy (which are all basically the
same thing).


#### Locations {#locations}

-   **Capital City:** Whichever city the monarch's house is in.


#### People {#people}

-   **Important NPCs:**
    -   King Romstein
    -   General Maximilian
    -   Reverend Velecia

    -   Barno Henchor
-   **Task Force Members:**
    -   Zorro


### Empire of Xylte {#empire-of-xylte}

A territorial and xenophobic empire, one of the few which has actually conquered
land after the founding of the Koncord. The Empire started as Republic before a
series of increasingly brutal civil wars caused the Republic of Xylte to
condense and centralize power into a Consul who then overthrew the Senate and
declared an Empire.


#### Government Structure {#government-structure}

The Imperial Cult of Xylte recognizes the Emperor, his wife and first born son
as divinely sanctioned to rule the Empire. The Emperor has absolute power over
other the government, the people, their religion and most importantly the
military.


#### Location {#location}

-   **Capital City:** Maestri

<!--list-separator-->

-  Ændor

    One of the most notable events in recent history was the conquering of Ændor
    in 1623. A small satellite nation of elves on the western border of the Empire.
    After years of aggressive behavior, when Ændor's King died it was the perfect
    time for Xylte to take over. After stripping Ændor of its legal protection, the
    army of Xylte invaded, burning the small nation nearly to the ground. Many
    military strategists believe that the only reason that the Ændorran elves
    weren't completely massacred was the presence of troops from the Ecihen Kingdom.

### Kingdom of Galimatias {#kingdom-of-galimatias}

A progressive kingdom with a issue with undead, Galimatias is the economic hub
of the basin, rich in materials from the most mountainous parts of the boundary
ring and fertile fields. Cultural festivals are a cornerstone of the Galimatian
year, with three major festivals celebrating birth, death and the renewal of the
year.


#### Government Structure {#government-structure}

The government is controlled by a King and Queen, a title passed down by blood,
who rule with a divine mandate from the two primary deities of the land,
Perun the God of Guidance and Mokosz the Goddess of Earth. While the Church also
holds considerable political power, the monarchy is firming in control of both
domestic and foreign policy.


#### Locations {#locations}

Galimatias is divided into several districts

-   Jeden - Farming district
-   Dwa - Fishing district
-   Piec - Research district
-   Siedem - Business district
-   Osiem - Mining district


#### People {#people}

-   **Task Force Members:**
    -   Breagan


### Kingdom of Trobreryn {#kingdom-of-trobreryn}

A mercantile kingdom and the shipping hub of the Basin. Although each nation has
a territorial boundary waters extending into Kratermeer, the majority of the
lake is ruled as territorial waters of Trobreryn, allowing them to control most
of the boat traffic on the lake.


#### Government Structure {#government-structure}

Formally the Kingdom of Trobreryn is a monarchy, ruled by the Rosach family.
However, a guild system also exists which regulates the lucrative trade economy.
The monthly formal meeting between the monarch and the guild leaders is called
the Guildmaster Gathering.

Notable guilds include:

-   Merchant Guild
-   Mage Guild
-   Bard Guild
-   Farmer Guild
-   Builder Guild
-   Medical Guild
-   Non-denominational Clerics Guild

    -   Hand of the Guilds Peric Abell
-   **Task Force Members:**
    -   Wil Ragnory


### Niven Imperium {#niven-imperium}

The Niven Imperium is undoubted a force to be reckoned with, if they ever wanted
to. This government is relatively isolationist and stagnant. That last major
reform was implemented over 200 years ago. While the three major cities are
decadent and bustling, the status of the villages and farmers is relatively
unknown. The Imperium is also known to be the only government with several
settlements on the outer flanks of the boundary ridge of the Basin.


#### Government Structure {#government-structure}

The Imperium is ruled by an Emperor, who has absolute power but rarely uses it.
Most of the daily administration of the Imperium is facilitated between military
leader, the Shogun and the primary advisor to the Emperor, who uses the title of
Adobaizā.


#### Places {#places}

-   **Capital City:**
    -   Daitoshi - An absolutely massive city rife with vice and violence under the
        less than watchful personal guard of the Emperor.
-   **Secondary Cities:**
    -   Machi - Smaller and located deep in the mountains, Machi started as a
        research station working with rare mountain ores but has since grown into a
        large alpine city. It is still home to the Machi Laboratories, a renowned
        research facility that seems to be in decline, overtaken by newer facilities
        in other kingdoms.
    -   Mura - Smaller than even Machi, Mura is the agricultural hub of the empire,
        where farmers come from the fertile plains below the mountains to sell goods
        up the main trade route to Daitoshi and Machi.


#### People {#people}

-   **Four Important NPCs:**
    -   Shogun Ichika, the Dragon Slayer
        -   Ichika is a brilliant strategist, and one of the most respected generals
            in the Great Basin, famous for her single handed take down of a black
            dragon hunting travelers in a mountain pass now know as the Tail of the
            Dragon that left her without a left arm or left eye.
    -   Emperor Yuusei
        -   Whatever Yuusei wants he shall receive, and as a result he wants for
            nothing. He few obligations include being the formal head of state of the
            Imperium, so he travels to other governments when needed.
    -   Daimyo Riku
        -   A Diamyo is a regional warlord and Riku is the warlord of Machi. His
            forces are thus well equipped and the most fearsome constituent of the
            military forces of the Imperium.
    -   Adobaizā Aoi
        -   The Adobaizā is the personal advisor of to the Emperor and spiritual
            leader of the Imperium, and since she administers the daily operation of
            the empire, Aoi wields considerable internal power.
-   **Forum Delegates:**
    -   Daimyo Akabashi
    -   Daimyo Ikoma
-   **Four Common Names:**
    -   Mio
    -   Koharu
    -   Souta
    -   Haru
-   **Language of Inspiration:** Japanese


### Principality of Vi {#principality-of-vi}

The people of the Principality of Vi are deeply religious as the Church of
Kroina, the goddess of foresight holds vast power within the principality and as
of late increasingly opposed to arcane magic.


#### Government Structure {#government-structure}

One of the notable things to be aware of with the Principality is that while the
Princess has the most power on paper, the people of the principality are very
deeply religious, so much political power also resides in the Church and the
Highpriest. Most "laws" within the principality are actually Holy Mandates from
the church. The current highpriest, Orden Wur, has been leaning a crack down on
arcane magic since he came to power 32 years ago. The Church also enforces its
Mandates, leaving the formal government primarily dealing with other government
and managing the relation between the Principality and the Koncord.


#### Locations {#locations}

-   **Capital City:**
    -   Cerca - A fortress city on the shore of the Carter Lake, home to the
        Princess's Palace and the Central Cathedral.
-   **Secondary City:**
    -   Vurki - The economic center of the Principality, as the Church dictates a
        separation between the divine and the mundane of the economy.


#### People {#people}

-   **Four Important NPCs:**
    -   Highpriest Orden Wur
    -   Princess Luria Vi
    -   Hereditary Princess Viven Vi (daughter of the Princess)
    -   Liaison to the Church, Mu Sarka
        -   The official bridge between the Princess and the Highpriest.
-   **Four Common Names:**
    -   Bur
    -   Juska
    -   Stef
    -   Ami
-   **Language Tools:** Names should be short with long vowel sounds. See the [Jamaican
    Names](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/jamaican-names.php) fantasy name generator.


### Roksduens {#roksduens}

In the east of the Great Basin lies a desert and a constant struggle for
survival. Raids from savages outside the Basin make the harsh life here even
harder. Due the extreme nature of Roksduens, their formal government is limited
and most of their cultural practices are designed to help them survive the
extreme environment. One such example utilizes a unique type of creatures called
ediolons which bond with a particular summoner. The summoners frequently have
duels between ediolons as training for the raids that are sure to follow.


#### Government Structure {#government-structure}

There are six tribes that comprise the Roksduens,

-   _Tomo:_ Located in the center of the Roksduens, this tribe is the closest that
    the Roks have to a trade hub and because of that one of the only ones who can
    organize things across tribes.
-   _Tema:_ Run over out of a large village on the Western border of Roksduens. This
    is the only place information gets into or out of the Roksduens, making it a
    critically important among the otherwise ignorant Roks.
-   _Kuraab:_ South of the deserts are some rain forests, and in the rain forests
    are the hunter gatherer tribe of Kuraab, harvesting exotic plants from
    forests.
-   _Kricrem:_ In the northern parts of Roksduens the rolling hills start to give
    away to mountains and here lie the Kricrem tribe. The Kricrem are focused on
    innovation and artifice, but despite their hard work the raids destroy most of
    their progress.
-   _Calchiroos:_ Sitting on the Eastern border of Roks, the Calchiroos tribe is
    beaten each and every day, either by the harsh desert or the near constant
    raids.
-   _Kuboma:_ Next of the Svängbar river is the fishing Kuboma tribe.


#### Locations {#locations}

-   **Capital City:** Tomo or Tema would probably fill that role.


#### People {#people}

-   **Important NPCs:**
    -   Hibiscian Saffren, Elder of Tomo Tribe
    -   Rabiat Talare, Elder of Tema Tribe
    -   Blota Trad, Elder of Kuraab Tribe
    -   Iskall Stenson, Elder of Kricrem Tribe
    -   Sandiga Ridbyxor, Elder of Calchiroos Tribe
    -   Lugna Vatten, Elder of Kuboma Tribe

    -   Redfern Taiga


## The Koncord of Kieros {#the-koncord-of-kieros}

After the nascent governments had solidified their hold on regional power
structures, it became clear that some structure was required to prevent the loss
of life as the new powers jostled for position. The result was the Koncord of
Kieros, a diplomatic forum where the nations could discuss their grievances and
seek redress without resorting to war. Interestingly, there is no founding
document for the Koncord, merely fragments of Kieros's journal and centuries of
tradition.

The ruling council of the Koncord is called the Forum, composed of two delegates
from each nation. The powers of the Forum are intentionally ill defined and wide
ranging. Anything to prevent a war within the basin. The Forum operates on a
system of resolutions and grievances. Resolutions are non-enforceable decrees
that all members should follow, while grievances are allegations of wrong doing
filed be a plaintiff against a respondent. Resolutions can to anything from
mandate the market price of goods or add and remove members from the council.
Grievances have been used to stop executions of high value political prisoners,
expose spies or do things as petty as force a kingdom to take down unflattering
artwork of another kingdom’s ruler.

If no resolutions or grievances have been filled about a topic, then the Koncord
has no official stance on it and anything goes. The few times it has become an
issue, the Forum’s parliamentarian has ruled that resolutions are binding across
multiple instances of an issue but grievances are never binding outside of their
original context, however they can be argued as precedent in future rulings on
any issue.


### Kerkard {#kerkard}

Clearly whichever government hosted the Forum meetings would have considerably
more power over the meeting than the rest. A neutral location was needed and the
heart of Xylte was still floating above the basin. A meeting place was soon
established on top of this massive piece of floating rock and over the years
developed into a large city. It is a mixing pot of people and good from all over
the Basin.


### Forum Delegates {#forum-delegates}

There are twenty forum delegates and five spacial roles.

1.  **Herske:** The formal head of the Forum, equivalent to a Prime Minister. They
    control the schedule for the Forum and are also the tie-breaking vote.
2.  **Krig:** The military leader and coordinator for all joint military operations
    that the Koncord conducts.
3.  **Regler:** The parliamentarian who maintains the rules and protocols of the
    Forum.
4.  **Viden:** Scientific and arcane liaison, required to oversee research that the
    Koncord funds and track recent developments by the arcane schools of the Basin.
5.  **Penge:** Economic advisor and regulates inter-state trade.

While they are listed with their respective government, the delegates are also
listed here.

### Secondary Organization {#secondary-organization}

There are three notable secondary organizations that are run by the Koncord.

-   **Library of the Muse:** The official library and record keeping body of the
    Koncord. This is the organization that Oisin is attached to and his reason for
    being in the task force.
-   **Truthspeakers:** A network of bards paid by the Koncord to deliver the news of
    the forum to the Koncord.
-   **Bastion of the Sky:** The police of Kerkard and enforces of the Koncord. It is a
    small guard force who only has jurisdiction on Kerkard or if explicitly
    granted by the Forum.


## The Task Force {#the-task-force}

At the annual Founder's Gala at the end of Goldwave, all of the delegates and
dignitaries gather and acknowledge the history of the Koncord and remember the
Shattering.

During this event, an explosion went off and the Sword of Divinity was stolen.
This sword was on Xylte when the first explorers managed to let back to the
floating asteroid and was wielded by Kieros herself during her heroic effort to
save the Basin.

A task force was created to recover the sword, and the player characters were
selected to serve on that Task Force.

A chronicle of the activities of the Task Force can be found on this website.
However, notable events include:

-   34 Goldwave 1763: The Sword of Divinity is stolen.
-   02 Fireharvest 1763: Jusa Lok appointed as task force member from the
    Principality of Vi (NPC Cleric).
-   03 Fireharvest 1763: Alisha Shamra found potentially tampering with the Trance
    Wine in the Church of Kroina on Kerkard.
-   05 Fireharvest 1763: Task Force obtains warrant and raids Alisha's shop for
    potential burglary crimes and selling illegal drugs.
-   09 Fireharvest 1763: In a report to the Forum, the task force recommends
    opening the docks with additional security restrictions.
-   19 Fireharvest 1763: In the middle of the night, a quite blast wakes up
    several members of the task force. A search reveals a large fire burning in
    Taerwyn, the capital of Trobreryn which is near where Kerkard is floating.
    During the following days, the task force uncovers evidence that the explosion
    was caused by the same explosive which was found at the site of the Forum
    bombing. Not only that, but also that the explosive was distributed by the
    Keburipemi Syndicate, a large organized crime group from the Niven Imperium.

    While infiltrating a Keburipemi safe house, the task force meets Niwa, an
    evidently high ranking member of the syndicate looking to embarrass the one
    running the Taerwyn operation, an undine named Vicious.
-   22 Fireharvest 1763: Using the evacuation plans leaked by Niwa, the Task Force
    collaborates with the Taerwyn guard lead by Nessa Preston to apprehend them.
    The resulting operation is mostly a success, capturing the boat and a
    substantial amount of drugs. While Vicious managed to escape, his underling
    Voracious was captured.
-   28 Fireharvest 1763: A packet of documents comes into the procession of the
    Task Force, a letter from Niwa explaining more of the details of the
    explosive, called Cylex, and how they were going to sell it to a group in the
    Eichen Kingdom.
-   32 Fireharvest 1763: The rescheduled sale of the Cylex takes place in Daquin,
    a small town in Trobreryn. Thanks to the heads up from Niwa, the Task Force is
    able to intercept both parties and apprehend the 30 pound barrel of Cylex. The
    leader of the Eichen delegation, Marius Kleinheisterkamp is captured.
-   33 Fireharvest 1763: During an interrogation with Marius (who has been
    rendered blind by Oisin), the task force learns about a group of disenchanted
    Eichen wounded veterans who believe that the government is conducting
    experiments on their soldiers. When Zorro and his sword learn about this
    later, the sword dominates Zorro and attempts to Coup de Grâce a bound Marius.
    He is unsuccessful thanks to quick intervention by Oisin, Redfern and Breagan.
-   03 Shimmerfall 1763: After several days of travel, the Task Force arrives back
    in Kerkard and books Marius and a lackey from the Syndicate into the prison
    their.
-   04 Shimmerfall 1763: While Oisin and Breagan are attending the Annual
    Symposium of Arcane Masters, the rest of the Task Force interrogates
    Voracious. He seeks willing to talk and reveals that he and Vicious where once
    pirates on a ship called the _Sanguine Ravager_ and that Vicious is a member of
    the group which stole the Sword of Divinity, a group called the League Against
    Koncord Eminence before his prison cell is flooded with negative energy and
    he dies. When Eaton, the investigative head of the Bastion of the Sky, tries
    to investigate Voracious's death, the Task Force refuses to answer question
    except those from the Forum, forcing Eaton to call an emergency Forum session.
    At said session, the members of the Forum pressed the Task Force for answer,
    and they likewise refused to answer specifics, threatening to reveal dirty
    secrets on each government who threatened them again. The Delegates decided
    not press further.
-   07 Shimmerfall 1763: Steven Hetzler, the truthspeaker of Kerkard, leaks that
    the Sword of Divinity has been stolen during bombing. However, the task force
    was not metioned.
-   10 Shimmerfall 1763: The Task Force attends the Niven Lantern Festival under
    the guidance of Delegate Ikoma. After the Task Force steals Raifusutīrā, the
    life stealing katana, Niwa whisks them away to an unknown location in the
    Niven forest.

This realm has two moons, the larger one is Zion, Bringer of War and the smaller
one is Izrail, Bringer of Peace.

Zion is so named due to its reddest hue while Izrail has a bright white hue,
brighter than our moon Luna. Their is a lot of superstition regarding the moons
and astrology and like what time of the moon cycles are best for assassinations
and peace treaties, etc.
