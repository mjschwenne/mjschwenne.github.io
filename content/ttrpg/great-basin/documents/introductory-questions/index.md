## Koncord of Kieros {#koncord-of-kieros}

All of the governments are members of Koncord of Kieros. The Koncord
serves as a formal discussion forum and supervisory body for all of the
local governments. The Koncord was founded by Kieros to protect the
entire region from some threat. Good contenders are a war between all of
the kingdoms or a massive natural disaster like a meteor impact or a
plague, something were the governments needed to set aside their
differences and work together.

The below statement in italics is false, but left here for historical
reasons.

_After the founding of the Koncord, Kieros's clan took over the administration_
_of the Koncord. Past Caretakers of the Koncord have been authoritarian and_
_treated the rest of the governments as subjects, but the current Prime Minister_
_is very relaxed and the modern Koncord is very similar to the United Nations,_
_tending to pass non-binding resolutions._

The Koncord is based out of the flying city of Kerkrad, which is also
mobile and travels the region. It is connected to its consistent capital
cities via teleportation circles.

    the council, which gets the final say. Grievances can interrupt
    internal processes via threat of sanctions.
-   What was the catastrophic event that lend to the creation of the
    Koncord? Or do you not know? Kerkrad is the heart of a meteor that
    crashed into the region, and the Koncord was the only way to save any
    life. Climate effects? What is the state of the region.
-   What would it take for Koncord military forces step in? Facilitate
    join service but no standing force except for guards for Kerkrad.

    roles? Polemarch, research head, economic lead, prelimintarian.

    implementation specific.
