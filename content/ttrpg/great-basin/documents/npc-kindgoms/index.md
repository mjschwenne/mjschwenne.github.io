There are four NPC kingdoms in the Great Basin. Below you will find a brief
description of each, a few notable people in each and some common names among
the commoners.


## Atreides Duchy {#atreides-duchy}

The Atreides Duchy is located in the northwest of the Great Basin, directly
above the Principality of Vi. The government of the Duchy is centered around the
Duke and Duchess, currently Leto and Jessica Atreides. There capital city of
Caladan is not opulent like some other capital cities, but it is very
welcoming. That describes the Atreides people well, not the wealthiest, but very
generous and sharing with others. They are one of the first to offer assistance
to other kingdoms and because of this are generally well liked by the other
members of the Koncord.


#### Government Structure {#government-structure}

The title of Duke is hereditary, pasted from parents to the eldest child through
the generations. The Duke and Duchess serve as the executive seat of power,
directing the military and negotiating with the other kingdoms. Laws are
enforced by the Duke and Duchess but passed by the Landsraad, a legislature
consisting of representatives from towns and cities of the Duchy with a set
number of representatives per population bracket. Individual cities are able to
pick representative however they feel.


#### Locations {#locations}

-   **Capital City**:
    -   Caladan

    -   Bellfort


#### People {#people}

-   **Four Important Figures**:
    -   Duke Leto Atreides
    -   Duchess Jessica Atreides
    -   Master at Arms Gurney Halleck
        -   Leader of the military forces of the Duchy. While these forces are small,
            Halleck is an well known and respected warrior and likewise the quality of
            the Atreides infantry is very high.
    -   Mentat Thufir Hawat
        -   The Mentat title is a very important one within the Atreides Duchy,
            reversed for a trusted advisor with a truly formidable breadth of
            knowledge. Hawat uses a spacial meditative state to strength his mental
            abilities.
-   **Four Common Names**:
    -   Molly
    -   Thomas
    -   Robert
    -   Katherine
-   **Naming Guidelines**: British English


## Commune of Atrxous {#commune-of-atrxous}

Most of the other governments have centralized power structure, but not the
Commune of Atrxous. This government is communism, enforced via a magic contract
called The Atrxous. Once you sign the contract, you agree to share all of your
wealth, shed your social status and live for the betterment of the
Commune. Violating the contract is impossible, enforced via enchantment magic
and the transmutation of the valuable to the worthless.


#### Government Structure {#government-structure}

Formally speaking, there is no structure to the government since there is
effectively no government. Generally there is no need for one either since the
Atrxous prevents crimes from being committed against others who have signed it.


#### Locations {#locations}

-   **Capital City**: (If they formally had one)
    -   Atrxous

        -   Hardly more than a hamlet, Atrxous holds the contract in the only

        fully stone building in the Commune


#### People {#people}

-   **Important NPCs**:
    -   Forum Delegate Brigita Červinkov
    -   Forum Delegate Leopold Kadlec
-   **4 Common Names**:
    -   Ludvik
    -   Kristian
    -   Saskie
    -   Dagmar
-   **Language of Inspiration**: Longer names, often with harsh consonant
    sounds. Similar to Czech.


## Niven Imperium {#niven-imperium}

The Niven Imperium is undoubted a force to be reckoned with, if they ever wanted
to. This government is relatively isolationist and stagnant.  That last major
reform was implemented over 200 years ago. While the three major cities are
decadent and bustling, the status of the villages and farmers is relatively
unknown. The Imperium is also known to be the only government with several
settlements on the outer flanks of the boundary ridge of the Basin.


#### Government Structure {#government-structure}

The Imperium is ruled by an Emperor, who has absolute power but rarely uses
it. Most of the daily administration of the Imperium is facilitated between
military leader, the Shogun and the primary advisor to the Emperor, who uses the
title of Adobaizā.


#### Places {#places}

-   **Capital City**:
    -   Daitoshi

        -   An absolutely massive city rife with vice and violence under the

        less than watchful personal guard of the Emperor.
-   **Secondary Cities**:
    -   Machi
        -   Smaller and located deep in the mountains, Machi started as a research
            station working with rare mountain ores but has since grown into a large
            alpine city. It is still home to the Machi Laboratories, a renowned
            research facility that seems to be in decline, overtaken by newer
            facilities in other kingdoms.
    -   Mura
        -   Smaller than even Machi, Mura is the agricultural hub of the empire, where
            farmers come from the fertile plains below the mountains to sell goods up
            the main trade route to Daitoshi and Machi.


#### People {#people}

-   **Four Important NPCs**:
    -   Shogun Ichika, the Dragon Slayer
        -   Ichika is a brilliant strategist, and one of the most respected generals
            in the Great Basin, famous for her single handed take down of a black
            dragon hunting travelers in a mountain pass now know as the Tail of the
            Dragon that left her without a left arm or left eye.
    -   Emperor Yuusei
        -   Whatever Yuusei wants he shall receive, and as a result he wants for
            nothing. He few obligations include being the formal head of state of the
            Imperium, so he travels to other governments when needed.
    -   Diamyo Riku
        -   A Diamyo is a regional warlord and Riku is the warlord of Machi.  His
            forces are thus well equipped and the most fearsome constituent of the
            military forces of the Imperium.
    -   Adobaizā Aoi
        -   The Adobaizā is the personal advisor of to the Emperor, and since she
            administers the daily operation of the empire, Aoi wields considerable
            internal power.
-   **Four Common Names**:
    -   Mio
    -   Koharu
    -   Souta
    -   Haru
-   **Language of Inspiration**: Japanese


## Principality of Vi {#principality-of-vi}

One of the notable things to be aware of with the Principality is that while the
Princess has the most power on paper, the people of the principality are very
deeply religious, so much political power also resides in the Church and the
Highpriest. Most "laws" within the principality are actually Holy Mandates from
the church. The current highpriest, Orden Wur, has been leaning a crack down on
arcane magic since he came to power 32 years ago. The Church also enforces its
Mandates, leaving the formal government primarily dealing with other government
and managing the relation between the Principality and the Koncord.


#### Locations {#locations}

-   **Capital City**:
    -   Cerca
        -   A fortress city on the shore of the Carter Lake, home to the
            Princess's Palace and the Central Cathedral.
-   **Secondary City**:
    -   Vurki
        -   The economic center of the Principality, as the Church dictates a
            separation between the divine and the mundane of the economy.


#### People {#people}

-   **Four Important NPCs**:
    -   Highpriest Orden Wur
    -   Viven Vi (daughter of the Princess)
    -   Princess Luria Vi
    -   Liaison to the Church, Mu Sarka
        -   The offical bridge between the Princess and the Highpriest.
-   **Four Common Names**:
    -   Bur
    -   Juska
    -   Stef
    -   Ami
