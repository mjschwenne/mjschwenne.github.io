On 28 Fireharvest 1763, a packet of paperwork including this letter came into
procession of the Task force.

> Greetings, members of the Task Force.
>
> As promised, I will uphold my part of our bargain as you did foil Vicious's
> evacuation of Taerwyn.
>
> Cylex was created by a military scientist serving under Daimyo Riku at a
> laboratory in Machi named Ichijou Torime, who is working diligently to
> increase our manufacturing capacity after being abducted.
>
> The Cylex which exploded that night had already been sold. I do not know what
> the plans for the Cylex was after the point of sale; professional courtesy is
> important in this line of work after all.
>
> The contact for the sale was an Eichhörnchen named Hans. The handoff was
> supposed to take place at the warehouse in Taerwyn which is currently a pile
> of rubble, on Fireharvest 23rd. Hans was to arrive in a small boat with three
> other Eichhörnchen.
>
> Obviously since the Cylex exploded during the raid by the Taerwyn enforcers,
> it was not possible to complete the deal as contracted. Being difficult to
> manufacture, the stockpile in Taerwyn was the only large amount of Cylex in
> existence.
>
> Manufacturing capabilities have continued to grow and a new barrel of Cylex is
> expected to be ready soon. The trade-off with Hans will occur on Fireharvest
> 32nd in a town called Duquin in the Kingdom of Trobreryn.
>
> As for the Syndicate's production of Cylex, that is not something that I have
> control over. However, with your help those winds could change. Did you know
> that the Niven Lantern Festival is coming up next month? It is a major
> festival to celebrate the work that went into the summer harvest and marks the
> start of fall. The celebration at the Niven Imperial Palace is very exclusive
> and also one of the few times where outsiders are not under constant
> surveillance. If you're interested in going, you'll have to use some of your
> connections to get onto the official invite list.
>
> Remember that this is a silk kimono event. If you need a tailor, I recommend
> visiting The Midnight Lotus in Daitoshi. Ask for Takayama.

Within this packet is also several invoices written in Niven and Eichen
between the two parties as they negotiated for the sale of the Cylex. Notable
things include:

1.  The Keburipemi Syndicate reached out to Hans about selling the explosive.
2.  The final negotiated price was 100,000 gp for one barrel (about 50 gallons).
3.  Another Eichhörnchen is named in the negotiations: Marius Kleinheisterkamp
4.  Voracious was the agent negotiating on behalf of the Syndicate.
5.  The name of the boat for the original rendezvous was "suchende Welle" or
    "Seeking Wave".
